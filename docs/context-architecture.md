# Context Architecture for PM Toolkit

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Specification

---

## Overview

This document defines the **context architecture** for the Product Management Toolkit - a standardized approach to gathering, storing, and reusing product/business context across all agents and skills.

### Benefits

The `.claude/product-context/` architecture provides:

- **One-time setup**: 15-20 minutes via `/pm-setup` creates reusable context
- **Fewer questions**: Agents read context files first, ask only for gaps
- **Better outputs**: Product-specific results instead of generic outputs
- **Workflow efficiency**: Context gathered once in Phase 0, reused across all phases
- **Universal reuse**: Same context files power all PM tools

---

## Context Directory Structure

### Core Files (Created by /pm-setup)

The `/ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup` command creates these 8 required context files:

```
project-root/
  .claude/
    product-context/
      product-info.md             # Product description, value prop, users
      business-metrics.md         # ARR, users, growth, key metrics
      strategic-goals.md          # Goals, priorities, strategic themes
      current-roadmap.md          # Now-Next-Later roadmap
      tech-stack.md               # Architecture, tech stack, constraints
      customer-segments.md        # Personas, ICP, segments
      team-info.md                # Team size, roles, constraints
      competitive-landscape.md    # Competitors, market position
```

### Suggested Optional Structure

You can add additional context files and directories as needed. These are examples, not required:

```
project-root/
  .claude/
    product-context/
      # Optional supplementary files (examples)

## How Agents Use Context

### Pattern 1: Direct File Reading (Agents)

Agents should first **attempt to read context files**, then ask for missing information:

```markdown
## Context Gathering

**Step 1: Read Context Files**

Attempt to read:
- `.claude/product-context/product-info.md`
- `.claude/product-context/business-metrics.md`
- `.claude/product-context/strategic-goals.md`
- [agent-specific files]

**Step 2: Extract Relevant Information**

From context files, extract:
- [Field 1]
- [Field 2]
- [Field 3]

**Step 3: Identify Gaps**

Check if required information is present. If missing:
- [Question 1 if Field 1 missing]
- [Question 2 if Field 2 missing]
- [Question 3 if Field 3 missing]

**Step 4: Proceed with Task**

Use gathered context + user input to complete task.
```

**Example** (requirements-engineer agent):
```
Step 1: Read `.claude/product-context/product-info.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `customer-segments.md`
Step 2: Extract: product description, target users, tech stack, architecture
Step 3: Missing: Specific feature requirements → Ask user "What specific feature are you building?"
Step 4: Generate PRD with full product context + specific feature details
```

---

### Pattern 2: Context Parameter (Commands)

Commands should accept context files as input, fall back to questions:

```markdown
## Instructions

**Context from command**: $ARGUMENTS

### 1. Gather Context

**Attempt to read context files**:
- `.claude/product-context/product-info.md`
- `.claude/product-context/business-metrics.md`
- [command-specific files]

**If files exist**: Use data from files
**If files missing**: Ask user these questions:
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]
- [Question 3]

### 2. Execute Command

[Command logic using context]
```

---

### Pattern 3: Phase 0 Context Gathering (Workflows)

All workflows should start with Phase 0 for comprehensive context gathering:

```markdown
## Phase 0: Context Gathering (5-10 minutes)

Before starting the workflow, gather all essential context.

### Step 1: Check for Context Files

Attempt to read required context files:
- `.claude/product-context/product-info.md` ✅/❌
- `.claude/product-context/business-metrics.md` ✅/❌
- `.claude/product-context/strategic-goals.md` ✅/❌
- `.claude/product-context/current-roadmap.md` ✅/❌
- [workflow-specific files]

### Step 2: Validate Completeness

For each file found, check if it contains required fields:
- product-info.md: product_name, stage, target_users, value_proposition
- business-metrics.md: arr, total_users, growth_rate
- strategic-goals.md: current_goals, priorities

### Step 3: Gather Missing Context

**If files missing or incomplete**, gather from user:

#### Essential Context (always required):
1. Product: [If product-info.md missing] "What product is this for? Describe in 2-3 sentences."
2. Stage: [If stage missing] "What stage? (idea/MVP/PMF/growth/mature)"
3. Goals: [If strategic-goals.md missing] "What are your top 3 strategic priorities this quarter?"
4. Metrics: [If business-metrics.md missing] "What are your key metrics? (ARR, users, growth rate)"

#### Workflow-Specific Context:
[Questions specific to this workflow]

### Step 4: Save Context for Reuse

For any information gathered from user:
```
Create/update context files:
- If product info gathered → update .claude/product-context/product-info.md
- If metrics gathered → update .claude/product-context/business-metrics.md
- If goals gathered → update .claude/product-context/strategic-goals.md
```

**Benefit**: Future workflows won't need to ask these questions again.

### Step 5: Package Context for Phases

Create comprehensive context object with all gathered information:
```
CONTEXT = {
  product: [from product-info.md or user],
  metrics: [from business-metrics.md or user],
  goals: [from strategic-goals.md or user],
  roadmap: [from current-roadmap.md or user],
  team: [from team-info.md or user],
  [workflow-specific context]
}
```

### Step 6: Checkpoint

Display context summary:
```
Context Gathered:
==================
Product: [product_name] - [stage]
Users: [total_users], ARR: [arr]
Strategic Focus: [top_priority]
[Workflow-specific context]

✅ Context saved to .claude/product-context/ for future reuse

Proceed to Phase 1? (yes/no)
```

---

## Phase 1+ Agent Invocations

All agent invocations in workflows should receive FULL context:

```markdown
## Phase [N]: [Phase Name]

**Agent**: `agent-name`

**Task**: Use Task tool to invoke agent:

```
subagent_type: "plugin-name::agent-name"
description: "[5-word description]"
prompt: "[Agent-specific instruction]

**CONTEXT** (from Phase 0):

**Product**:
[Insert product info from Phase 0]

**Business Metrics**:
[Insert metrics from Phase 0]

**Strategic Goals**:
[Insert goals from Phase 0]

**Current Roadmap**:
[Insert roadmap from Phase 0]

**Team Info**:
[Insert team info from Phase 0]

**Previous Phase Output**:
[Insert output from Phase N-1]

**Your Task**:
[Specific instruction for this phase]"
```

**Key**: Agent gets BOTH broad context (product, metrics, goals) AND specific input (previous phase output).
```

## Context File Maintenance

### When to Update

Context files should be updated:
- **Quarterly**: Strategic goals, roadmap, metrics baselines
- **Monthly**: Business metrics, team info
- **As needed**: Tech stack, competitive landscape, customer segments

### How to Update

**Option 1**: Edit files directly
```bash
# Open in editor
vi .claude/product-context/business-metrics.md

# Update metrics section
# Save and close
```

**Option 2**: Use `/pm-setup --update` command
```bash
# Interactive update of context files
/pm-setup --update

# Will prompt for updates to each file
```

**Option 3**: Inline during workflows
When workflows detect stale context, they can prompt:
```
⚠️  business-metrics.md last updated 3 months ago
Update metrics now? (yes/no)
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with `/pm-setup`
Before using PM tools extensively, run:
```bash
/pm-setup
```
This creates all 8 core context files with guided prompts (15-20 minutes one-time setup).

### 2. Keep Context Current
Set calendar reminders:
- Weekly: Update business metrics
- Monthly: Update roadmap and team info
- Quarterly: Update strategic goals

### 3. Don't Duplicate Context
If context exists in docs/ or elsewhere, reference it:
```markdown
# In .claude/product-context/tech-stack.md

## Architecture
See detailed architecture in `docs/architecture.md`

**Summary**: Microservices architecture with React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database
```

### 4. Version Control Context Files
Add to `.gitignore` if context contains sensitive data:
```gitignore
# In .gitignore
.claude/product-context/business-metrics.md  # Contains revenue data
.claude/product-context/competitive-landscape.md  # Contains competitive intel
```

Or commit if sharable within team:
```bash
git add .claude/product-context/
git commit -m "Update Q4 strategic goals and roadmap"
```

---

## Implementation Guide

### For Existing Projects

**Step 1**: Run context setup
```bash
/pm-setup
```

**Step 2**: Test with an agent
```bash
Tell requirements-engineer: "Write a PRD for dark mode feature"
# Should read product-info.md and ask fewer questions
```

**Step 3**: Iterate and refine
Update context files based on what questions still get asked frequently.

---

### For New Projects

**Step 1**: Initialize project with Claude Code
```bash
cd my-new-product
claude-code init
```

**Step 2**: Set up PM context
```bash
/pm-setup
```

**Step 3**: Start using PM tools
All agents and skills will have rich context immediately.
