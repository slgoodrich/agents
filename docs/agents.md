# Agent Reference

## Overview

The Product Management Toolkit provides **9 AI agents** covering the complete PM lifecycle: 1 orchestrator, 7 PM specialists, and 1 utility agent. PM specialists use Claude Sonnet for sophisticated strategic reasoning, while the utility agent uses Haiku for efficient operational tasks.

**Agent-First Architecture:** Conversational PM through specialized agents instead of command memorization. The `product-manager` agent acts as an intelligent router, directing requests to appropriate specialists.

## Agent Routing Pattern

### The product-manager Agent

The **product-manager** agent is your primary entry point - an intelligent router that:

1. **Analyzes requests** to identify PM discipline(s) needed
2. **Routes to specialists** automatically (research-ops, feature-prioritizer, etc.)
3. **Coordinates workflows** when multiple specialists are needed
4. **Synthesizes outputs** into cohesive recommendations

**When to use product-manager:**
- Unsure which specialist to consult
- Multi-faceted problems (e.g., "validate and prioritize feature X")
- General PM guidance and questions
- Complex workflows requiring multiple specialists

**When to bypass:**
- You know exactly which specialist you need
- Simple, focused requests
- Direct conversation with a specialist

**Routing examples:**

```
Tell product-manager: "Help me prioritize features"
→ Routes to feature-prioritizer

Tell product-manager: "Validate this feature idea and create a launch plan"
→ Routes to research-ops, then launch-planner
→ Synthesizes complete validation + GTM plan

Tell product-manager: "I need to plan Q2"
→ Routes to product-strategist for goals
→ Routes to roadmap-builder for roadmap
→ Routes to feature-prioritizer for backlog
→ Synthesizes complete quarterly plan
```

**Direct invocation (bypasses routing):**
```
Tell feature-prioritizer: "Score these 10 features with RICE"
Tell research-ops: "Design a churn study"
Tell roadmap-builder: "Create now-next-later roadmap"
```

## Multi-Agent Workflows

### Sequential Pattern
Agents work one after another, passing context forward.

**Example: Feature Development**
```
1. research-ops → Validate user need
2. product-strategist → Align with strategy
3. requirements-engineer → Write comprehensive PRD
4. feature-prioritizer → Score against backlog
5. roadmap-builder → Plan timeline
6. launch-planner → Prepare GTM
```

### Parallel Pattern
Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects.

**Example: Quarterly Planning**
```
In parallel:
- market-analyst → Competitive landscape
- research-ops → User needs research
- product-strategist → Draft goals

Then synthesize:
- roadmap-builder → Create quarterly roadmap with all inputs
```

### Iterative Pattern
Agents refine each other's work through multiple passes.

**Example: PRD Refinement**
```
Round 1: requirements-engineer → Draft PRD
Round 2: research-ops → Validate with customers
Round 3: requirements-engineer → Incorporate feedback
Round 4: feature-prioritizer → Confirm priority
Round 5: roadmap-builder → Finalize timeline
```

---

## Model Configuration

All agents (1 orchestration + 7 specialists) use **Claude Sonnet** for:
- Complex strategic reasoning
- Nuanced decision-making
- Deep contextual understanding
- High-quality, comprehensive outputs

This ensures consistent expert-level performance across all PM disciplines.

---

## Choosing the Right Agent

### By PM Activity

**Strategic Planning** → product-strategist, market-analyst
**Research & Discovery** → research-ops, market-analyst
**Planning & Prioritization** → roadmap-builder, feature-prioritizer

**Goals** → product-strategist
**Roadmap** → roadmap-builder
**Prioritized Backlog** → feature-prioritizer
**Research Plan** → research-ops
**Launch Plan** → launch-planner
**Market Analysis** → market-analyst

## Utility Agents

Utility agents perform specialized operational tasks to support PM agents. They are not domain experts but provide essential capabilities that enable faster, more accurate PM work.

### 9. context-scanner
**Specialty:** Strategic context discovery from codebase
**Model:** Haiku (optimized for file operations)

**Core Purpose:**
Automatically discovers strategic product context from existing codebases to populate `.claude/product-context/` files during setup. Enables fast, accurate onboarding on existing projects.

**What it discovers:**
- **Features:** User-facing functionality from routes, pages, API endpoints
- **Tech Stack:** Frontend/backend frameworks, databases, languages from package manifests
- **Integrations:** 3rd party services from package dependencies (Stripe, SendGrid, etc.)
- **Scale:** Project size (files, LOC), complexity, maturity level

**What it doesn't do:**
- Code quality or architecture analysis (engineering territory)
- Performance or security assessment
- Technical recommendations or best practices
- Business logic analysis

**Key principle:** Facts not interpretation - reports WHAT exists, not HOW it's built or WHETHER it's good.

**Invoked by:**
- pm-setup command (during initial setup or refresh)
- market-analyst (when needing current feature inventory for competitive analysis)
- feature-prioritizer (when identifying gaps for prioritization)
- Any PM agent needing current product state

**Example flow (automatic invocation):**
```
User runs: /product-management:pm-setup

pm-setup detects codebase:
"I've detected an existing codebase. Scan to auto-discover context? (yes/no)"

User: yes

pm-setup invokes context-scanner via Task tool:
→ context-scanner scans file structure, package.json, routes, etc. using Read/Glob/Grep
→ context-scanner presents findings as structured markdown to user
→ All findings include evidence and confidence scores

context-scanner presents findings to user:
"Discovered from Codebase:
✓ Authentication (login, signup) [High confidence]
✓ Projects (CRUD operations) [High confidence]
✓ Analytics [Medium confidence - please verify]

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React 18.2, TypeScript 5.0
Backend: Node.js 20, Express 4.18
Database: PostgreSQL

Integrations:
- Stripe (payments)
- SendGrid (email)

Is this accurate?"

User validates (confirms, corrects, adds missing items)

context-scanner saves validated data to context files using Write tool:
- current-features.md (NEW FILE)
- tech-stack.md (UPDATED)
- product-info.md (UPDATED)

Control returns to pm-setup to continue setup workflow

Time saved: 10-15 minutes vs manual entry
```

**Example flow (invoked by PM agent):**
```
User: "Tell market-analyst: How do we compare to competitors?"

market-analyst checks if current-features.md exists and is recent:
→ If missing/stale: Invokes context-scanner via Task tool
→ context-scanner scans, user validates, saves current-features.md
→ Control returns to market-analyst
→ market-analyst reads current-features.md
→ Uses for competitive comparison
→ Returns: "You have core PM features (auth, projects, tasks) but lack timeline view, resource management, and portfolio features that Asana and Monday.com offer..."
```

**How it works:**
1. Scans codebase using Read/Glob/Grep tools
2. Organizes findings internally (features, tech stack, integrations, scale)
3. Presents findings as **structured markdown** to user
4. Requests user validation (confirm/add/remove/correct)
5. Saves validated data to context files using Write tool

**What it discovers:**
- Features (from routes, pages, API endpoints)
- Tech stack (from package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Integrations (from 3rd party packages)
- Project scale (files, approximate LOC, complexity)
- All findings include evidence (file paths) and confidence scores (high/medium/low)

**Validation required:**
All discoveries must be confirmed by user before saving to context files. This prevents hallucination and ensures accuracy.

**Differences from PM specialists:**
- **Model:** Haiku (fast, efficient file operations) vs Sonnet (strategic reasoning)
- **Purpose:** Operational (gather facts) vs Strategic (provide guidance)
- **Workflow:** Conversational with user (scan → present → validate → save) vs Direct agent-to-user PM advice
- **Invocation:** By pm-setup command or PM agents via Task tool vs Direct user requests
- **Scope:** Context discovery only vs Full PM discipline expertise

## Agent Invocation Patterns

### Natural Language (Recommended)
```
Tell product-manager: "I need help planning Q2"
Tell research-ops: "Design a churn study"
Tell roadmap-builder: "Create a 6-month roadmap"
```

### Conversational
```
"I need to prioritize 10 features"           → Routes to feature-prioritizer
"Help me validate this feature idea"         → Routes to research-ops
"Create Q2 goals"                            → Routes to product-strategist
```

### Multi-Agent Request
```
Tell product-manager: "Validate this feature, prioritize it, and plan delivery"
→ Coordinates research-ops, feature-prioritizer, requirements-engineer, roadmap-builder
```

---

## Context Architecture

All agents reference `.claude/product-context/` files (created by `/product-management:pm-setup`):

**8 context files:**
- product-info.md
- business-metrics.md
- strategic-goals.md
- current-roadmap.md
- tech-stack.md
- customer-segments.md
- team-info.md
- competitive-landscape.md

**Benefits:**
- Agents ask 80% fewer questions
- Outputs are product-specific
- Context reused across all agents
- Consistent understanding across workflows

**Pattern:**
1. Agent checks for relevant context files
2. Extracts applicable information
3. Only asks for missing information
4. Produces context-aware output

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with product-manager for Complex Requests
Let the router determine which specialists are needed.

### 2. Go Direct for Focused Work
When you know exactly what you need, invoke the specialist directly.

### 3. Provide Context
Rich context produces better outputs. Use pm-setup or provide inline context.

### 4. Chain Agents Intentionally
Design logical sequences: research → strategy → prioritization → specs → launch

### 5. Iterate and Refine
Don't expect perfection on first output. Ask follow-up questions and refine.
