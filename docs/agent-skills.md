# Agent Skills Reference

## Overview

**Skills** are specialized knowledge frameworks that extend agent capabilities in specific product management domains. They provide deep expertise in methodologies, frameworks, and best practices without loading everything into context upfront.

Skills use **progressive disclosure**: they activate only when needed, keeping interactions token-efficient while providing comprehensive PM knowledge when required.

---

## How Skills Work

### Activation Mechanism

Skills activate automatically based on request patterns:

```
User: "Prioritize these features using RICE"
↓
feature-prioritizer agent activates
↓
Detects "RICE" keyword → Loads prioritization-frameworks skill
↓
Applies RICE methodology from skill knowledge
↓
Returns scored features with detailed rationale
```

### Three-Tier Architecture

**1. Metadata** (Always loaded)
- Skill name and category
- Activation triggers
- When to use guidance

**2. Instructions** (Loaded on activation)
- Step-by-step methodology
- Framework application
- Decision criteria

**3. Resources** (Referenced as needed)
- Detailed examples
- Case studies
- Templates and tools

### Benefits

**Token Efficiency**
- Load only what's needed when needed
- Agents stay lightweight
- More room for user context

**Specialized Expertise**
- Deep framework knowledge
- Consistent methodology application
- Updated best practices

**Composability**
- Multiple agents can use same skill
- Skills combine for complex scenarios
- Clear knowledge boundaries

**Maintainability**
- Update framework knowledge without changing agents
- Add new skills without modifying existing agents
- Version skill knowledge independently

## Skill Composability

### Multi-Skill Scenarios

Agents can load multiple skills for complex tasks:

**Example: Complete Feature Prioritization**
```
User: "Prioritize these features considering effort,
business value, and strategic fit"

feature-prioritizer agent:
1. Loads prioritization-methods skill (RICE/ICE/Kano)
2. Loads roadmap-frameworks skill (strategic alignment)
3. Applies multiple frameworks for comprehensive scoring

Result: Comprehensive prioritization using multiple lenses
```

### Cross-Agent Skill Usage

Multiple agents can reference the same skill:

**Example: Product Positioning**
```
product-strategist + market-analyst
→ Both reference product-positioning skill
→ Consistent positioning framework across strategy
→ Unified market approach
```

## Creating New Skills

### When to Create a Skill

Create a skill when:
-  2+ agents need the same knowledge
-  It's a well-defined framework or methodology
-  It's reusable across scenarios
-  It's substantial enough to warrant separation

Don't create a skill when:
-  Only one agent uses it (include in agent directly)
-  It's too specific to one scenario
-  It's simple enough to be inline instructions

# Which agents will use it?
# What are the activation triggers?
```

**Step 2: Create File**
```bash
# Choose appropriate plugin directory
cd plugins/product-execution/skills/

# Create skill file
touch feature-flagging-strategy.md
```

**Step 3: Add Frontmatter**
```yaml
---
name: feature-flagging-strategy
description: Progressive rollout, targeting, and feature management strategies
category: technical
activation_triggers:
  - feature flag
  - feature toggle
  - progressive rollout
  - canary release
agents:
  - technical-pm
  - product-ops
version: 1.0.0
updated: 2025-10-18
---
```

**Step 4: Write Content**
Follow the skill file format structure above.

**Step 5: Test Activation**
```
# Test with agent
Tell technical-pm: "How should we roll out this feature using feature flags?"

# Verify skill loads
→ Should reference feature-flagging-strategy skill
→ Should apply progressive rollout frameworks
```

### Skill Versioning

Skills follow semantic versioning independently:

```yaml
# Minor content update (backward compatible)
version: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0

# Major framework change (breaking)
version: 1.1.0 → 2.0.0

# Bug fix or clarification (patch)
version: 1.1.0 → 1.1.1
```
