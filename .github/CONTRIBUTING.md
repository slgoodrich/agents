**Expected behavior:**
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Prioritize quality over speed

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and configured
- Git for version control
- Markdown editor (VS Code, Obsidian, etc.)
- Basic understanding of product management concepts

### Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agents.git
cd agents

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/slgoodrich/agents.git
```

### Install Plugin Locally

```bash

```

---

## Ways to Contribute

Found a bug? Please open an issue with:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Test results (run TEST_PLAN.md if applicable)
- Claude Code version

### 2. Feature Requests

Have an idea? Open an issue describing:
- Problem you're trying to solve
- Proposed solution
- Why this would benefit solo developers/small teams
- Example use cases

### 3. Agent Improvements

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create Branch

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Changes

Follow the patterns and conventions in existing files.

### 3. Test Changes

```bash
# Run automated test suite
cd "/Library/Developer/src/Projects/Claude Code Plugins/Agents"
bash test_runner.sh

# Manual testing in Claude Code
/plugin install /path/to/your/fork
# Test your changes
```

### 4. Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new skill for lean startup frameworks"
# or
git commit -m "fix: Correct frontmatter in market-analyst agent"
```

**Commit message conventions:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `test:` Adding or fixing tests
- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Agent Contributions

### Creating a New Agent

**When to create:**
- Covers a distinct PM discipline not handled by existing 8 agents
- Has clear, focused responsibilities
- Would be used by solo developers/small teams

**When NOT to create:**
- Overlaps significantly with existing agents
- Too specialized (create a skill instead)
- Corporate PM focused (stakeholder management, executive alignment)

### Agent Structure

Follow this template for new agents:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: One-line description of specialty and use cases
model: sonnet
---

# Agent Name

## Purpose

High-level mission and value proposition.

## Core Philosophy

Foundational principles this agent follows.

## Capabilities

Detailed breakdown of what this agent can do:
- Capability 1
- Capability 2
- Capability 3

## Skills Activated

Skills this agent loads on-demand:
- skill-name-1
- skill-name-2

## Response Approach

Step-by-step process for handling requests:
1. Analyze request
2. Load relevant skills
3. Apply frameworks
4. Generate response

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: [Scenario]

**User:** "[realistic request]"

**Agent:** "[detailed response showing approach]"

### Example 2: [Scenario]

**User:** "[another realistic request]"

**Agent:** "[response demonstrating different capability]"

## When to Use This Agent

Use when:
- Scenario 1
- Scenario 2

Don't use when:
- Other agent is better suited
- Task is too simple

## Integration with Other Agents

How this agent collaborates:
- Works with X agent for Y workflow
- Hands off to Z agent when...
```

### Agent Checklist

## Skill Contributions

### Creating a New Skill

**When to create:**
- 2+ agents would use this knowledge
- Well-defined framework or methodology
- Reusable across scenarios
- Substantial enough to warrant separation

**When NOT to create:**
- Only one agent uses it (add to agent instead)
- Too specific to one scenario
- Simple enough for inline instructions

### Skill Structure

Each skill includes:
1. **SKILL.md** - Main skill file with frontmatter
2. **assets/** - Templates, frameworks, checklists
3. **references/** - Guides, best practices, methodologies

**Directory structure:**
```
skills/
└── your-skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── assets/
    │   ├── template-1.md
    │   ├── framework-2.md
    │   └── checklist-3.md
    └── references/
        ├── guide-1.md
        └── best-practices-2.md
```

**SKILL.md template:**

# [detailed tests from TEST_PLAN.md]
```

**Required passing tests:**
- Configuration validation (plugin.json, marketplace.json)
