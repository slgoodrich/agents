# AI PM Copilot for Claude Code

> Answer PM's hardest questions in minutes, not days

**Expert PM guidance powered by frameworks from Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, April Dunford, and more - without hiring a PM.**

Right feature. Right users. Right time. Right reasons.

Not a project management tool. Not a generic AI assistant. A specialized copilot that combines:
- **Speed of AI** (answers in minutes)
- **Depth of PM frameworks** (Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, April Dunford)
- **Context-aware reasoning** (remembers your product, personalizes outputs)

Built for solo developers and small teams who need enterprise PM capabilities without the complexity.

## Why AI PM Copilot?

**You're a solo founder building your first product.** You can code, but PM decisions feel like guesswork:
- "Should I build feature X or Y first?"
- "How do I validate this idea without wasting weeks?"
- "Which users should I target?"
- "When is the right time to launch?"

**Generic AI** (ChatGPT, Claude): Fast answers, but no PM frameworks or strategic depth  
**Enterprise PM tools** (Jira, Aha!): Deep features, but slow, complex, and expensive  
**Manual PM work** (Notion, templates): Flexible, but requires expertise you don't have  

**AI PM Copilot:** Expert PM frameworks + AI speed = rigorous answers delivered in minutes.

Built on 16 proven methodologies from PM thought leaders. Context-aware intelligence that remembers your product. Developer-native experience inside Claude Code.

## Built on Proven PM Frameworks

AI PM Copilot isn't generic AI advice - it's built on expert frameworks from PM thought leaders:

**Research & Discovery:** Teresa Torres (Continuous Discovery), Erika Hall (Just Enough Research)  
**Strategy & Goals:** Marty Cagan (Empowered), Sean Ellis (Product-Market Fit), April Dunford (Positioning)  
**Execution & Planning:** Jeff Patton (Story Mapping), Basecamp (Shape Up), Google (HEART/Goals)  
**Prioritization:** Intercom (RICE), Dan Olsen (Lean Product Playbook)  

16 proven methodologies. 100+ templates and frameworks. Expert rigor at AI speed.

## How It Works

**Just talk to your PM expert agents like you would a consultant:**

```
You: "Tell product-manager: I'm building a SaaS analytics tool. Should I prioritize dashboards or API access first?"

product-manager: Let me help you score these features using RICE framework...

[Routes to feature-prioritizer]
[Reads your product context from setup]
[Returns scored recommendations with rationale]

Result: Expert RICE scoring in 2 minutes with explanation of why each feature ranks where it does.
```

**Try it yourself:**
1. Install: `/plugin install ai-pm-copilot`
2. Setup (optional, 5-10 min): `/ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup`
3. Ask: "Tell product-manager: [your PM question]"

## Agents

The toolkit provides 1 orchestration agent, 7 specialist agents, and 1 utility agent that work together to cover the complete product lifecycle:

### 1. product-manager (Main Router)
**Your primary entry point** - Intelligent agent that routes requests to specialized experts

**Use for:**
- General PM questions and guidance
- Multi-faceted problems requiring multiple perspectives
- When unsure which specialist to consult

**Example:**
```
Tell product-manager: "I need to validate a feature idea, prioritize it, and plan delivery"
→ Routes to research-ops, feature-prioritizer, and requirements-engineer
```

### 2. market-analyst
**Market research, competitive analysis, and positioning**

**Use for:**
- Competitive landscape analysis

- Research program design

**Example:**
```
Tell research-ops: "Design a study to understand why 30% of users churn after first month"
Tell research-ops: "Synthesize these interview transcripts into themes and insights"
```

### 4. product-strategist
**Vision, strategy, and goals**

**Use for:**
- Product vision and strategy
- Quarterly and annual goals
- Strategic roadmaps

```

### 5. roadmap-builder
**Roadmap planning and sequencing**

**Use for:**
- Now-Next-Later roadmaps
- Theme-based roadmaps
- Quarterly planning
- Feature sequencing and phasing
- Milestone planning

**Example:**
```
Tell roadmap-builder: "Build a 6-month roadmap for our mobile app launch"
```

### 6. feature-prioritizer
**RICE, ICE, and prioritization frameworks**

**Use for:**
- RICE/ICE scoring
- Kano model analysis
- Value vs Effort matrices
- Trade-off decisions
- Backlog ranking

**Example:**
```
Tell feature-prioritizer: "Score these 10 features using RICE framework"
```

### 7. requirements-engineer
**PRDs, specs, and user stories**

**Use for:**
- Product requirements documents (PRDs)
- Technical specifications
- User story writing
- Acceptance criteria
- Feature documentation

**Example:**
```
Tell requirements-engineer: "Write a comprehensive PRD for dark mode feature"
```

### 8. launch-planner
**Go-to-market and launch execution**

**Use for:**
- Launch planning and execution
- GTM strategy and distribution channel selection
- Beta programs
- Launch messaging and positioning
- Community launches (Product Hunt, Hacker News, Reddit)

**Example:**
```
Tell launch-planner: "Create a launch plan for our new API product"
```

### 9. context-scanner (Utility Agent)
**Automated strategic context discovery from codebase**

**Use for:**
- Auto-discovering features, tech stack, and integrations during setup
- Refreshing stale context when product changes
- Getting accurate baseline for competitive analysis
- Fast onboarding on existing projects

**What it discovers:**
- Features (from routes, pages, API endpoints)
- Tech stack (from package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Integrations (from 3rd party packages)
- Project scale (files, LOC, complexity)

**What it doesn't do:**
- Code quality or architecture analysis
- Performance or security assessment
- Engineering recommendations

**Note:** This is a utility agent (not a PM specialist) that uses Haiku model for efficient file operations. It's automatically invoked by pm-setup when you have an existing codebase, or can be invoked by PM agents when they need current product state.

**Example (automatic invocation):**
```
/ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup
→ Detects codebase
→ "Scan codebase to auto-discover context? (yes/no)"
→ If yes: context-scanner runs, presents findings for validation
→ Time saved: 10-15 minutes vs manual entry
```

## Agent Routing Pattern

The **product-manager** agent acts as an intelligent router that:

1. Analyzes your request to understand the PM discipline(s) needed
2. Routes to the appropriate specialist agent(s)
3. Coordinates multi-agent workflows when needed
4. Synthesizes outputs from multiple specialists

**Simple routing:**
```
Tell product-manager: "Help me prioritize features"
→ Routes to feature-prioritizer
```

**Multi-agent workflow:**
```
Tell product-manager: "Validate this feature idea and create a launch plan"
→ Routes to research-ops (validation)
→ Then to launch-planner (GTM strategy)
→ Synthesizes complete plan
```

**You can also bypass routing:**
```
Tell feature-prioritizer: "Score these features with RICE"
→ Goes directly to specialist
```

## Skills

Skills are knowledge frameworks that agents load progressively when needed, organized by the product development journey:

### Stage 1: Validation (Before writing code)
Is this idea worth my time? Who are my competitors?
- **competitive-analysis-templates** - SWOT, Porter's Five Forces, competitive positioning
- **market-sizing-frameworks** - TAM/SAM/SOM, market validation
- **product-positioning** - April Dunford framework, differentiation strategy

### Stage 2: Understanding (Who am I building for?)
Who are my users? What problems am I solving?
- **user-research-techniques** - Interviews, surveys, usability testing, JTBD
- **interview-frameworks** - Interview design, questioning, synthesis
- **synthesis-frameworks** - Affinity mapping, insight generation
- **usability-frameworks** - Usability testing, Nielsen principles
- **validation-frameworks** - Problem/solution validation, MVP testing

### Stage 3: Scoping (What's the MVP?)
What features do I build? How do I avoid scope creep?
- **prioritization-methods** - RICE, ICE, Kano, Value vs Effort
- **product-market-fit** - PMF indicators, Sean Ellis test, MVP scoping

### Stage 4: Speccing (Make Claude Code build it well)
Clear requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
- **specification-techniques** - Requirements writing, clarity
- **prd-templates** - PRD formats and best practices
- **user-story-templates** - User story formats, INVEST criteria

### Stage 5: Planning (What's my roadmap?)
Phase 1, 2, 3 and milestone planning
- **roadmap-frameworks** - Now-Next-Later, outcome-based roadmaps

### Stage 6: Launch (How do I get users?)
Where do I launch? What's my messaging?
- **go-to-market-playbooks** - GTM strategies, distribution channels
- **launch-planning-frameworks** - Launch tiers, timelines, execution

## Setup Command

### /ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup

**One-time context setup that makes everything better.**

Creates 8 core context files that all agents reference:

```
.claude/product-context/
  ├── product-info.md          # Product description, users, value prop
  ├── business-metrics.md      # ARR, users, growth, retention
  ├── strategic-goals.md       # Goals, priorities, themes
  ├── current-roadmap.md       # Now-Next-Later roadmap
  ├── tech-stack.md           # Architecture, tech, constraints
  ├── customer-segments.md     # Personas, segments, ICP
  ├── team-info.md            # Team size, roles, constraints
  └── competitive-landscape.md # Competitors, positioning
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents ask 80% fewer questions
- Outputs are product-specific, not generic
- Context reused across all agents and skills

**Usage:**
```bash
# First-time setup
/ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup

# Update context later
/ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup --update
```

## Creating PRDs

Use **requirements-engineer** to create Product Requirements Documents with automatic template selection:

```
Tell requirements-engineer: "Write a PRD for [your feature]"
```

**Intelligent Template Selection:**
requirements-engineer uses complexity assessment to automatically select the right template:

**How it works:**
1. Assesses 3 dimensions: Technical Complexity, Risk/Impact, Scope Breadth (0-10 each)
2. Reads repository context (`.claude/product-context/tech-stack.md`, etc.) for informed scoring
3. Applies decision thresholds based on average complexity score
4. Communicates reasoning transparently with complexity breakdown

**Templates:**
- **Lean PRD** (1-2 pages): Low complexity (avg < 4), < 1 week, simple features
- **Comprehensive PRD** (3-5 pages): Moderate complexity (avg 4-7), standard features [DEFAULT]
- **Amazon PR/FAQ** (3-6 pages): New products (detected by keywords)
- **Google PRD** (5-10 pages): High risk (security/payments) or scale-critical (high complexity)

**Example reasoning:** "OAuth authentication" → Google PRD (Risk: 9/10 security-critical, triggers high-detail template)

You can always request a different template if the automatic selection doesn't fit your needs.

**Storage:**
PRDs are automatically saved to `prds/[feature-name].md` using kebab-case naming:
- `prds/dark-mode.md`
- `prds/csv-export.md`
- `prds/user-notifications.md`
