## Introduction (5 minutes)

**Welcome and rapport building**:

"Hi [Name], thanks so much for joining us today! How are you doing?"

[Small talk to make them comfortable]

**Set expectations**:

"Today we're testing [product/feature name] to see how it works for people like you. Just to be clear upfront: we're testing the product, not you. There are no right or wrong answers, and you can't do anything wrong. If something doesn't work or is confusing, that's exactly what we need to know so we can improve it.

I'll ask you to try a few tasks and think out loud as you go—just say whatever comes to mind. I'll be taking notes, and we're recording [screen/audio/video] so I don't miss anything. Is that okay with you?"

[Wait for consent]

**Explain think-aloud**:

"The most helpful thing you can do is think out loud. Just say what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, what you're thinking. For example, if I'm looking for a coffee shop, I might say 'Okay, I'm on the homepage, I see a search box, I'll try typing coffee shop in there...' Make sense?"

**Questions before we start**:

"Do you have any questions before we begin?"

## Background Questions (5 minutes)

**Demographic/Screening validation** (if not already collected):
- "Can you tell me a bit about your current role?"
- "How long have you been doing [relevant activity]?"

**Relevant experience**:
- "Have you ever used [product category] before?"
- "What tools do you currently use for [relevant task]?"
- "How often do you [relevant task]?"

**Context for test product** (if not completely new):
- "Have you heard of [product name] before?"
- "If yes: What do you know about it?"

[Adapt these questions to your specific product and research goals]

---

## Tasks Section (40 minutes)

**General instructions before first task**:

"Great, thanks for that context. Now I'm going to give you a few scenarios to try. Remember to think out loud, and let me know if anything is confusing or unclear. And again, there's no right or wrong way to do this.

If you get stuck, that's okay—just do what you'd normally do if you were actually using this on your own. You can give up on a task if you want to. And I might ask you some follow-up questions as you go, but I won't be able to help you with the tasks themselves.

Sound good?"

## Customization Tips

**For early-stage prototypes**:
- Add more "what would you expect?" questions
- Focus on concept validation, not just usability
- Ask about missing features

**For comparative testing**:
- Test same tasks on competitor product first or after
- Ask explicit comparison questions

**For remote moderated tests**:
- Add tech check section at start
- Have backup communication method
- Be more explicit about think-aloud since you can't see them

**For unmoderated tests**:
- Convert to written instructions
- Pre-record instructions if using video
- Make success criteria clearer for auto-detection
- Add more post-task survey questions

**Remember**: This is a guide, not a rigid script. Adapt questions based on what you're learning. If something interesting comes up, probe deeper. Stay curious and neutral.
