# Task Scenario Template

## What Makes a Good Task Scenario?

A good task scenario is:
- **Realistic**: Based on actual user goals and motivations
- **Specific**: Clear success criteria
- **Self-contained**: Provides all necessary context
- **Actionable**: Clear starting point
- **Not prescriptive**: Doesn't tell users where to click or what steps to take

## Task Scenario Formula

```
[Context/Situation] + [Motivation/Why] + [Goal/What to accomplish]
```

## Examples: Poor vs. Good

### Example 1: Password Change

**Poor**:
"Click on 'My Account' and change your password."

**Why it's poor**:
- Tells user exactly where to click
- No realistic motivation
- Prescriptive path

**Good**:
"You've been reading about recent security breaches and want to make your account more secure. Change your password to something stronger."

**Why it's good**:
- Realistic motivation (security concern)
- Clear goal (stronger password)
- Doesn't prescribe the path
- Self-contained context

---

### Example 2: Finding Information

**Poor**:
"Go to the Help section and find the article about refunds."

**Why it's poor**:
- Tells them where to go
- No real user motivation

**Good**:
"You accidentally bought the wrong subscription tier and want to know if you can get a refund. Find out what the refund policy is."

**Why it's good**:
- Realistic mistake scenario
- Clear information need
- Lets them discover the path

---

### Example 3: E-commerce

**Poor**:
"Add a laptop to your cart and check out."

**Why it's poor**:
- Unrealistic (no context about why)
- Too simple, not representative of real behavior

**Good**:
"Your current laptop is running slow, and you need something more powerful for video editing. Find a laptop that would work well for editing 4K video and is within a $1,500 budget. You don't need to actually purchase it—just add it to your cart."

**Why it's good**:
- Realistic need (specific use case)
- Decision criteria provided
- Clear stopping point
- Enables testing of product filtering/search

## Task Complexity Guidelines

### Simple Tasks (1-3 clicks)
**Purpose**: Establish baseline usability, test navigation

**Example**: "Find your account settings"

**Use for**:
- Warm-up tasks
- Testing core navigation
- Quick usability checks

---

### Medium Tasks (3-7 clicks)
**Purpose**: Test realistic workflows, uncover common issues

**Example**: "Change your email notification preferences to only receive weekly summaries"

**Use for**:
- Primary task flows
- Most common user journeys
- Feature discovery

---

### Complex Tasks (7+ clicks, multiple steps)
**Purpose**: Test complete workflows, error handling, persistence

**Example**: "Set up a new campaign with three different audience segments, allocate budget across them, and schedule it to run next week"

**Use for**:
- Advanced features
- Multi-step processes
- Testing stamina and error recovery

---

## Providing Task Information

### Option 1: Verbal Instructions
**Facilitator reads scenario aloud**

**Pros**:
- More natural, conversational
- Can adjust wording on the fly

**Cons**:
- Participant may forget details
- Harder to stay consistent across participants

---

### Option 2: Written Cards/Sheets
**Participant reads scenario from paper or screen**

**Pros**:
- Can refer back as needed
- Consistent wording
- Participant sets their own pace

**Cons**:
- Slightly less natural
- Need to prepare materials

---

### Option 3: Combination
**Facilitator reads, participant has written version too**

**Best of both worlds**: Natural + referenceable

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Too Prescriptive
**Bad**: "Click the menu in the top-right corner and select Settings"
**Good**: "Change your password"

### 2. Using Product Terminology
**Bad**: "Create a new workspace and invite collaborators"
**Good**: "Set up a shared space where your team can work together"
(Unless you're specifically testing if users understand "workspace")

### 3. Unrealistic Motivation
**Bad**: "Find the about page"
**Good**: "You want to know what year the company was founded for a presentation you're giving"

### 4. Multiple Goals in One Task
**Bad**: "Update your profile, change your notification settings, and add a payment method"
**Good**: Split into 3 separate tasks

### 5. Impossible Tasks
**Bad**: "Find the user guide" (if no user guide exists)
**Make sure**: All tasks are actually possible with current product

---

## Adapting Task Scenarios for Different Test Types

### For Moderated Tests
- Can be slightly more open-ended
- Facilitator can clarify if needed
- Include motivation and context

### For Unmoderated Tests
- Must be extremely clear and self-contained
- Include all details participant needs
- Specify exact endpoint (e.g., "Stop when you've found the answer")

### For Prototype Tests
- Acknowledge limited functionality
- Focus on concept and flow rather than completion
- "Imagine this button worked—what would you expect to happen?"

---

## Task Prioritization

When you have limited time, prioritize tasks that:

1. **Represent critical user goals** - What must work for product to be valuable?
2. **Are frequently performed** - High-volume tasks have high impact
3. **Have known issues** - Validate fixes or explore problems
4. **Are recent changes** - Test new features before launch
5. **Cross multiple features** - End-to-end workflows reveal integration issues

---

## Sample Task Set for a Project Management Tool

```markdown
### Task 1: Create a Project (Simple)
"You're starting a new initiative to redesign your company website. Create a project to track this work."

### Task 2: Invite Team Member (Simple-Medium)
"You need your designer, Jamie, to collaborate on this project. Add Jamie (jamie@example.com) to the website redesign project."

### Task 3: Organize Tasks (Medium)
"The website redesign has three main phases: Research, Design, and Development. Organize your project to reflect these phases."

### Task 4: Set a Deadline (Medium)
"Your CEO wants the website redesign completed by December 1st. Set up the project to track toward that deadline."

### Task 5: View Progress (Medium)
"You're preparing for your weekly status meeting. Get an overview of how the website redesign project is progressing."

### Task 6: Find Overdue Items (Medium-Complex)
"You think some tasks might be falling behind schedule. Find any overdue tasks across all your projects."
```

This set tests: creation, collaboration, organization, scheduling, reporting, and cross-project views.

**Remember**: Great task scenarios make participants forget they're in a test. They should feel like real problems they might actually need to solve.
