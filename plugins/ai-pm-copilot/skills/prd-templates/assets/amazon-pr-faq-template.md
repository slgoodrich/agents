# Press Release

## [Product/Feature Name]

**[Location] - [Launch Date]** - [Company Name] today announced [Product Name], [one-sentence description of what it is and what it does].

---

### Subheading

[One sentence describing who the market for the product is and what benefit they get]

**Example**:
"Small business owners can now manage their entire customer pipeline in one place, saving 10+ hours per week on admin work."

---

### Summary Paragraph

[3-4 sentences describing the product and why it matters. Should be quotable.]

**Example**:
"Managing customer relationships shouldn't require a PhD in software. Our new CRM is designed specifically for small businesses who don't have time to learn complex tools. Set up in 5 minutes, see your entire customer pipeline at a glance, and never miss a follow-up again. Unlike enterprise CRMs that cost thousands and take months to implement, our solution is simple, affordable, and works the way small businesses actually work."

---

### Problem

[Describe the problem this solves. Start with a story or example that leadership can relate to.]

**Example**:
"Sarah owns a boutique marketing agency with 8 employees. She tracks clients in a spreadsheet, follow-ups in her email, and invoices in QuickBooks. Last month, she lost a $50K client because a follow-up email fell through the cracks. She's tried enterprise CRMs but they're too complex - her team spent 2 weeks learning Salesforce and still couldn't use it effectively. She's stuck between inadequate spreadsheets and overwhelming enterprise tools."

"This is not Sarah's story alone. 68% of small businesses still use spreadsheets or email to manage customer relationships. They know they need something better, but existing tools aren't built for how they work."

---

### Solution

[Describe the solution and how it solves the problem]

**Example**:
"[Product Name] is a CRM built specifically for small businesses. Unlike enterprise CRMs, we've eliminated everything unnecessary and focused on the core workflow: see your customers, remember to follow up, and close deals. No training required, no complex setup, no features you'll never use."

"The entire customer pipeline is visible on one screen. Drag a customer from 'Interested' to 'Proposal Sent' to 'Closed.' The system automatically suggests follow-ups and reminds you when it's time to check in. Every customer interaction (emails, calls, meetings) is logged automatically. When you close a deal, invoice creation is one click away."

---

### Quote from Company Leader

"[Quote from CEO, CPO, or relevant executive about why this matters]"

**Example**:
"We built this for the Sarah's of the world," said [CEO Name], CEO of [Company]. "Small business owners are brilliant at their craft but drowning in admin work. They don't need Salesforce, they need a tool that gets out of their way and helps them focus on their customers. That's exactly what we've built."

---

### How to Get Started

[Describe how a customer can start using the product. Keep it simple.]

**Example**:
"Getting started with [Product Name] takes less than 5 minutes. Sign up at [website], import your customer list from any spreadsheet or email, and start managing your pipeline immediately. No credit card required for your first 30 days. Pricing starts at $20/month for small teams."

---

### Customer Quote

"[Quote from beta customer or persona describing their experience]"

**Example**:
"I had my entire customer list organized in under 10 minutes," said Maria Rodriguez, owner of Rodriguez Consulting. "For the first time, I can see exactly where every client is in my pipeline. Last week, the follow-up reminders helped me close two deals I would have forgotten about. This is the CRM I've been waiting for."

---

### Closing

[One sentence call to action]

**Example**:
"[Product Name] is available today at [website]. Try it free for 30 days and see why thousands of small businesses are ditching spreadsheets for good."

# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## External FAQ (Customer-Facing)

These are questions customers will ask. They should be answered in the press release or in your customer-facing materials.

### Q: How is this different from [Competitor]?

**A**: [Clear differentiation]

**Example**:
"Unlike Salesforce, Hubspot, and other enterprise CRMs, we're built exclusively for small businesses with under 25 employees. This means we've eliminated 80% of features that small businesses never use, making the product 10x simpler to set up and use. You can be up and running in 5 minutes instead of 5 weeks. Our pricing is also designed for small businesses - $20/month instead of $200/month."

---

### Q: How long does setup take?

**A**: [Honest answer with specifics]

**Example**:
"Most customers are fully set up in under 10 minutes. Import your existing customer list (we support CSV, Google Sheets, and Excel), review the automatically created pipeline, and you're ready to go. No IT support needed, no training required."

---

### Q: What if I need a feature that's not included?

**A**: [How you handle this]

**Example**:
"We're intentionally focused on the 20% of features that solve 80% of small business needs. If you need advanced features like marketing automation, complex reporting, or integrations with 50+ tools, enterprise CRMs like Salesforce or Hubspot might be better fits. However, if you need to see your customer pipeline, remember follow-ups, and close deals, we've got everything you need."

---

### Q: How do I import my existing customer data?

**A**: [Import process]

**Example**:
"Upload any CSV, Excel file, or Google Sheet with your customer information. We'll automatically map columns (name, email, phone, company) and import your data in seconds. You can also connect your email (Gmail or Outlook) to automatically import contacts and past email history."

---

### Q: What happens to my data if I cancel?

**A**: [Data portability and security]

**Example**:
"Your data is always yours. Export everything as CSV at any time. If you cancel, we'll keep your data for 90 days in case you want to reactivate. After 90 days, we'll permanently delete it per our data policy. No lock-in, no hostage data."

---

## Internal FAQ

These are hard questions your leadership and team will ask. Answer them honestly.

### Q: Why are we building this when [Competitor] exists?

**A**: [Strategic rationale]

**Example**:
"Existing CRMs serve the enterprise market extremely well, but small businesses are underserved. The enterprise CRM market is $50B+ but small business CRM is only $5B despite there being 10x more small businesses. This is because enterprise tools don't fit small business needs - they're too complex and too expensive. We believe there's a massive opportunity to build a CRM specifically for this segment, much like Mailchimp did for email marketing."

---

### Q: What's the business model? How do we make money?

**A**: [Revenue model and unit economics]

**Example**:
"Subscription SaaS model: $20/month per team (up to 5 users), $50/month for larger teams. Target 10,000 customers in year 1 ($200K/month recurring revenue) and 50,000 in year 3 ($1M/month). CAC target is $100 (paid advertising), LTV target is $600 (based on 30-month retention), giving us 6:1 LTV:CAC ratio. Gross margins should be 80%+ as a SaaS product."

---

### Q: What are the risks? What could go wrong?

**A**: [Honest risk assessment]

**Example**:
"Three major risks: (1) Market risk - small businesses may prefer free spreadsheets despite pain points. Mitigation: extensive beta testing with real small businesses. (2) Competition risk - Salesforce or Hubspot could launch simplified versions. Mitigation: move fast, build brand with target segment. (3) Technical risk - integrations with email and other tools may be harder than expected. Mitigation: start with core CRM, add integrations post-launch."

---

### Q: Why now? Why not last year or next year?

**A**: [Market timing]

**Example**:
"Three factors make now the right time: (1) Small business digital transformation accelerated by recent events - 70% more small businesses using software than 2 years ago. (2) Our team has deep expertise in both CRM and small business markets from previous roles. (3) Incumbent players have moved upmarket, creating a gap. Wait another year and someone else will fill this gap."

---

### Q: What resources do we need? What's the investment?

**A**: [Resource requirements]

**Example**:
"Need 8 people for 6 months to build MVP: 4 engineers, 2 designers, 1 PM, 1 marketing. Estimated development cost: $600K. Marketing budget for year 1: $400K. Total year 1 investment: $1M. Break-even projected at 18 months with 15,000 customers."

---

### Q: How do we know customers will pay for this?

**A**: [Validation evidence]

**Example**:
"We've conducted 50 customer interviews with small business owners. 38 (76%) said they'd pay $20-30/month for a solution like this. We ran a landing page test that converted 18% of visitors to the waitlist (2,400 signups in 2 weeks). We've pre-sold beta access to 50 small businesses at $10/month (reduced beta pricing), generating $500/month before we've built anything."

---

### Q: What does success look like in 6 months? 12 months? 24 months?

**A**: [Success metrics by timeframe]

**Example**:
"6 months: MVP launched, 500 paying customers, $10K MRR, 30% month-over-month growth
12 months: 5,000 paying customers, $100K MRR, net retention > 100%, CAC < $100
24 months: 25,000 paying customers, $500K MRR, profitable unit economics, series A raised if we want to accelerate growth"

---

### Q: What's our unfair advantage? Why can we win?

**A**: [Competitive advantage]

**Example**:
"Three advantages: (1) Focus - we only serve small businesses, not enterprises. This means every product decision optimizes for simplicity over power. (2) Team - our founding team has built CRMs before (worked at Salesforce) and served small businesses (worked at Square). We understand both domains deeply. (3) Brand - we'll become the 'small business CRM experts' through content marketing, much like Basecamp owns 'project management for teams.'"

---

### Q: What's the moat? How do we defend against competitors?

**A**: [Defensibility]

**Example**:
"Short-term moat: speed to market and brand in small business segment. Long-term moat: network effects (industry-specific templates contributed by users), switching costs (all customer data and history in our system), and brand (be the Mailchimp of CRM). We're not building a technology moat - simple CRM is not technically complex. We're building a brand and distribution moat."

---

### Q: What are we NOT doing? What's out of scope?

**A**: [Explicit scope]

**Example**:
"We are NOT building: enterprise features (complex workflows, custom objects, advanced reporting), marketing automation (email campaigns, landing pages), customer service tools (ticketing, knowledge base), or e-commerce features. We're laser-focused on pipeline management and basic customer relationship tracking. If we try to compete with full-featured enterprise CRMs, we'll lose our simplicity advantage."

---

### Q: How does this fit our overall strategy?

**A**: [Strategic alignment]

**Example**:
"This aligns with our 3-year strategy to own the small business software stack. We already have accounting (bought FinanceApp) and invoicing (built in-house). CRM is the natural next piece - customer relationships drive revenue which drives need for our accounting and invoicing products. Long-term vision is full small business operating system: CRM → Invoicing → Accounting → Payroll → HR."

## Tips for Writing PR/FAQ

### Do's:
- Write the PR first, FAQ second
- Write from customer perspective (what will they care about?)
- Be specific with metrics and timelines
- Be honest about risks and challenges
- Use real customer quotes (from interviews) if possible
- Make it readable by non-technical executives

### Don'ts:
- Don't use jargon or technical terms in PR
- Don't hide difficult questions in FAQ
- Don't write vague goals ("increase engagement")
- Don't make it too long (leadership won't read 20 pages)
- Don't skip the FAQ - that's where the real thinking happens

### Amazon's Working Backwards Philosophy

> "We try to work backwards from the customer, rather than forwards from an idea for a product."
> - Jeff Bezos

The PR/FAQ forces you to:
1. **Start with customer benefit** (not cool technology)
2. **Define success clearly** (measurable impact)
3. **Answer hard questions early** (before you invest)
4. **Think through business model** (not just product features)
5. **Identify risks proactively** (while you can still pivot)

**When to Use PR/FAQ vs Traditional PRD**:
- PR/FAQ: New products, major bets, customer-facing initiatives, strategic decisions
- Traditional PRD: Standard features, incremental improvements, internal tools
