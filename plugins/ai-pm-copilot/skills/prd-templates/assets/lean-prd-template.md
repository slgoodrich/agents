## Problem

[2-3 sentences describing the problem and who experiences it]

## Notes

**When to use Lean PRD**:
- Feature is straightforward and well-understood
- Low cross-functional complexity
- Development effort < 1 week
- Primarily for engineering team consumption

**Keep it lean**:
- Focus on problem and solution, not process
- Skip sections that don't add value
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Link to external docs instead of embedding
