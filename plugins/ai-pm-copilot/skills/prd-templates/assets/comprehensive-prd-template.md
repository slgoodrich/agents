# PRD: [Feature Name]

**Owner**: [PM Name] | **Status**: Draft
**Last Updated**: [Date] | **Target Release**: [Version/Date]

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraphs summarizing the feature, problem, solution, and expected impact]

This section should be readable in 2 minutes and give everyone everything they need to understand the initiative at a high level.

**Key Metrics**:
- [Metric 1]: [Current → Target]
- [Metric 2]: [Current → Target]

**Example**:
"We're building a collaborative workspace feature that allows team members to work together on documents in real-time. Currently, users must download, edit locally, and re-upload files, leading to version conflicts and wasted time. This new capability will reduce document collaboration time by 60% and is expected to increase team plan conversions by 25%."

---

## Problem Statement

### Customer Pain Point

[Describe the problem from the customer's perspective. Use specific examples and real user language.]

**Example**:
"Marketing teams using our product struggle to collaborate on campaign documents. Team members download files, make edits locally, and re-upload them. This creates multiple versions of the same document, making it unclear which is the 'source of truth.' Teams waste 2-3 hours per week just reconciling changes and resolving conflicts."

---

### Who Experiences This

- **Primary**: [User type] - [Why they experience this]
- **Secondary**: [User type] - [Why they experience this]

**Example**:
- **Primary**: Marketing managers at SMBs - coordinate campaigns across 3-8 team members
- **Secondary**: Content creators - need feedback from team members on drafts

---

### Impact if Not Solved

[Business and customer impact of not solving this problem]

**Business Impact**:
- Lost revenue from team plan downgrades
- Support burden from version conflict tickets
- Competitive disadvantage (all competitors offer this)

**Customer Impact**:
- Wasted time resolving conflicts
- Frustration and reduced productivity
- Risk of using competitor product for collaboration

---

### Evidence *(Include only if you have actual data)*

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The examples below show FORMAT only. Do NOT copy or fabricate similar data.
- **If you have real research/competitive data**: Use it and cite sources
- **If you don't have data**: Omit this section entirely (do not use placeholders)

Provide data and quotes that validate the problem when available:
- Customer quotes or feedback (from actual research)
- Data points or metrics (from analytics or surveys)
- Support ticket volume or research findings (with sources)

**Example format** (replace with actual data or omit section):
- "This is the #1 feature request in our NPS surveys" (mentioned by 42% of detractors)
- 1,200 support tickets/month related to version conflicts
- User interview quote: "I love your product, but we use Google Docs for anything that needs collaboration. I wish we could stay in one tool."
- Competitive analysis: 9 out of 10 competitors have real-time collaboration

---

### User Goals

Express goals from the user's perspective using job stories format.

- **As a [user type]**, I want to [goal] so that [benefit]
- **As a [user type]**, I want to [goal] so that [benefit]

**Example**:
- **As a marketing manager**, I want to edit documents simultaneously with my team so that we can finalize campaigns faster
- **As a content creator**, I want to see who's editing what so that I don't overwrite their changes
- **As a team lead**, I want to review version history so that I can see how documents evolved

---

## Proposed Solution

### Solution Overview

[High-level description of the solution, 2-3 paragraphs]

**Example**:
"We will add real-time collaborative editing to all document types in our product. Multiple users will be able to edit the same document simultaneously, with changes appearing in real-time for all participants. Each user's cursor position will be visible with their name/avatar, and changes will be synced automatically."

"The solution will use operational transformation (OT) to handle concurrent edits without conflicts. Users will see presence indicators showing who's currently viewing or editing. An activity panel will show recent changes and who made them."

---

### Key Capabilities

2. **[Capability 2]**: [Description]
3. **[Capability 3]**: [Description]

**Example**:
1. **Real-time editing**: Multiple users can edit simultaneously with sub-second sync
2. **Presence indicators**: See who's viewing/editing with cursor positions
3. **Conflict resolution**: Automatic merge of concurrent edits using OT algorithm
4. **Activity feed**: See who made what changes and when
5. **Version history**: Revert to any previous version

---

### User Experience

[Describe the user journey or workflow step-by-step]

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Example**:
1. User opens a document they own or have edit access to
2. If other users are currently viewing/editing, they see avatars at top of page
3. User begins typing - changes appear in real-time for all users
4. Other users' cursor positions are visible with color-coded labels
5. Activity panel (optional sidebar) shows recent changes
6. All changes auto-save; no explicit "Save" button needed
7. Version history accessible via menu shows snapshots every 30 minutes

[Optional: Include wireframes, mockups, or diagrams]

## Design & Technical Considerations

### Design

- [Design consideration or constraint]
- [UI/UX requirement]

**Example**:
- Presence indicators must not obstruct content
- Color-coding must be accessible (not just color-based)
- Design system components: Avatar, Cursor, Activity Panel
- Mobile experience is degraded (read-only for v1)

---

### Technical Approach

- [High-level technical approach or architecture]
- [Technology choices or constraints]

**Example**:
- Use Operational Transformation (OT) library: ShareDB or Yjs
- WebSocket connections for real-time sync
- Redis for presence/session management
- Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) as alternative if OT proves complex
- Document snapshots every 30 minutes for version history

---

### Dependencies

- [Dependency on another team/feature]
- [External service or API dependency]

**Example**:
- Infrastructure team: WebSocket server capacity
- Security team: Audit logging system integration
- Design team: Collaboration UI components
- External: ShareDB library evaluation complete

---

### Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How we'll mitigate] |

**Example**:
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| OT algorithm too complex | High (delays launch) | Medium | Have CRDT fallback researched |
| WebSocket scaling issues | High (poor UX) | Low | Load testing with 2x expected traffic |
| Conflict resolution bugs | High (data loss) | Medium | Comprehensive automated testing |
| Users don't adopt feature | Medium (ROI loss) | Low | Beta test with power users first |

---

## Out of Scope

Explicitly NOT included in this version:

- [Feature or capability 1]
- [Feature or capability 2]
- [Feature or capability 3]

**Why it's out of scope**: [Brief rationale]

**Example**:
- Mobile app support (web only for v1 - mobile adds complexity)
- Video chat during collaboration (separate feature, different team)
- AI-powered conflict resolution (future innovation)
- Collaborative cursor mode (niche use case, defer)
- Integration with external tools like Figma (v2 consideration)

These may be considered for future releases based on v1 learnings.

---
