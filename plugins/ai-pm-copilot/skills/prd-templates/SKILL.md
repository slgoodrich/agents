- Initiatives requiring executive approval

**Unique approach**: Emphasizes objectives (goals and non-goals), user benefits, and clear success criteria with measurable targets.

**Template**: `assets/google-prd-template.md`

---

## Core PRD Components

Regardless of template, great PRDs include these key elements:

### 1. Problem Statement

**Purpose**: Validate this is worth solving

**Include**:

- User pain point (describe from their perspective)
- Who experiences it (user segment, % affected)
- Impact if not solved (business + customer cost)
- Evidence (research, data, quotes)

**Good example**:
"Small business owners spend 5+ hours per week manually creating invoices, leading to delayed payments and cash flow issues. 68% of survey respondents cited invoicing as their #1 time sink. Current tools require accounting expertise most small business owners lack."

**Bad example**:
"We need an invoicing feature because competitors have one."

---

### 2. Goals & Success Criteria

**Purpose**: Define what winning looks like

**Include**:

- Business goals (revenue, efficiency, market position)
- User goals (what users can newly accomplish)
- Success metrics with baselines and targets
- Timeline for measurement (30/60/90 days)

**Make metrics SMART**:

- **Specific**: "Increase DAU" not "grow users"
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable number
- **Achievable**: Stretch but realistic
- **Relevant**: Ties to business goals
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadline

**Track both**:

- **Leading metrics**: Predict success (activation, engagement)
- **Lagging metrics**: Measure outcome (revenue, retention)

---

### 2.5. Evidence (Optional Section)

**Purpose**: Validate the problem with data

**CRITICAL - Never Fabricate Evidence**:

PRDs are specifications Claude Code uses to build features. Fabricated evidence leads to wrong implementations. All included evidence MUST be from real sources.

**Include Evidence section ONLY when you have**:

- Real user research (synthesized by research-ops or user-provided)
- Competitive analysis (from competitive-landscape.md or market-analyst)
- Support data (ticket volumes, customer quotes from user)
- Analytics data (user-provided metrics and usage patterns)

**If no evidence exists**: Omit the Evidence section entirely. Do not use placeholders or template examples as if they were real data.

**Valid evidence sources**:

- Context files: `competitive-landscape.md` (Stage 1), `customer-segments.md` (Stage 2)
- Specialist agents: research-ops synthesis, market-analyst competitive research
- User-provided: Support tickets, analytics, surveys, interview transcripts
- WebSearch: Current market data, competitor information

**Attribution required** - All evidence must cite source:

- "Synthesized from 6 interviews (research-ops, Oct 2025)"
- "From competitive-landscape.md (created Stage 1, validated Oct 2025)"
- "User-provided: 12 support tickets over 3 months"
- "WebSearch: Current competitor analysis (Oct 2025)"

**Template examples show FORMAT only**:

- Examples in templates demonstrate structure, not content to copy
- Never copy example numbers, quotes, or data as if they were real
- Replace with actual data or omit section

**Check context first**:

- Before asking user, check if `competitive-landscape.md` or `customer-segments.md` contain feature-relevant data
- If context files exist but don't cover this feature, ask user if new research is needed
- Route to specialist agents (market-analyst, research-ops) when beneficial

---

### 3. Proposed Solution

**Purpose**: Paint picture of what we're building

**Include**:

- High-level description (what and why)
- Key capabilities (what it can do)
- User experience (how users interact)
- Value proposition (why users care)

**Show, don't just tell**:

- User scenarios (storytelling)
- User flows (step-by-step)
- Mockups (visual representation)
- Concrete examples

---

### 4. Requirements

**Purpose**: Define what to build

**Functional requirements**:

- Number them (REQ-001, REQ-002)
- Use active voice ("System shall...")
- Be specific and testable
- Include acceptance criteria

**Non-functional requirements**:

- Performance (speed, latency, throughput)
- Security (authentication, authorization, encryption)
- Scalability (load handling, growth capacity)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance)
- Reliability (uptime, error rates)

**Prioritize ruthlessly**:

- **P0/Must**: Required for launch
- **P1/Should**: Important, can defer if needed
- **P2/Nice-to-have**: Future consideration

---

### 5. Out of Scope

**Purpose**: Prevent scope creep and maintain focus

**Why it matters**:

- Explicitly stating what we're NOT doing prevents scope creep mid-development
- Helps prioritization discussions
- Maintains focus on core value

**Include**:

- Features/capabilities explicitly excluded
- Brief rationale for each
- Note if it's "never" or "not now"

---

### 6. Launch Plan

**Purpose**: Define rollout strategy

**Include**:

- Rollout approach (phased, beta, full launch)
- Target segments or cohorts
- Success validation approach
- Go/No-Go criteria

---

## PRD Writing Best Practices

### Start with Why

Most PRDs start with "what". Great PRDs start with "why".

**Poor order**: "We're building guest checkout. Users will be able to..."
**Good order**: "Users abandon checkout because account creation adds friction (45% rate). To solve this, we're building..."

---

### Be Specific and Measurable

Vague language kills PRDs.

**Vague → Specific**:

- "Fast" → "Page load < 2 seconds (p95)"
- "Many users" → "35% of daily active users"
- "Improve engagement" → "Increase session length from 3min to 5min"
- "Easy to use" → "New users complete key task in < 5 minutes without help"

---

### Write for Clarity

Clear documentation serves multiple purposes:

**For implementation**: Clear requirements, acceptance criteria, non-functional requirements
**For yourself**: User scenarios, flows, edge cases, decisions and rationale
**For users**: Target audience, value proposition, differentiation

---

### Document Decisions and Rationale

Future you needs to know why decisions were made.

**Example**:
"We're starting with web only (no mobile app) because:

1. 80% of current usage is web
2. Mobile requires 3x development time
3. We can validate core value on web first
4. Mobile can launch in Q2 based on learnings"

---

### Use Visuals

**Tables** for comparisons, **diagrams** for flows, **mockups** for UI, **charts** for data.

A picture is worth a thousand words of requirements.

---

## Common PRD Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Solutionizing too early**: Start with problem, not "we need to build..."
❌ **Vague requirements**: "Fast" instead of "< 2 seconds"
❌ **Missing acceptance criteria**: No clear definition of "done"
❌ **No prioritization**: Everything is P0
❌ **Scope creep**: Adding "just one more thing" repeatedly
❌ **Missing success metrics**: No way to measure if it worked
❌ **No evidence**: "I think users want..." instead of data
❌ **Too long**: 20-page PRDs nobody reads

---

## Writing Clear PRDs for Solo Builders

For solo developers and small teams, PRDs serve as thinking documents and future reference.

### Start with a Brief

**Before writing full PRD**:

1. Draft 1-page overview (problem, solution, metrics, scope)
2. Validate direction with quick user feedback or research
3. Refine based on insights
4. Then write full PRD

**Why this works**:

- Low time investment if direction is wrong
- Easier to course-correct early
- Validates problem before deep specification
- Prevents over-planning before validation

---

### Self-Review Process

**Before finalizing**:

1. Step away for 24 hours
2. Re-read with fresh eyes
3. Ask: Would Claude Code understand this?
4. Ask: Would a new teammate understand this?
5. Update for clarity

**Review checklist**:

- Problem clearly stated with evidence
- Success metrics specific and measurable
- Requirements testable and complete
- Out of scope explicitly documented
- Decisions and rationale captured

---

## When NOT to Write a PRD

PRDs aren't always needed:

**Skip for**:

- Trivial changes (copy tweaks, simple bug fixes)
- Well-understood maintenance work
- One-person side projects
- Throwaway prototypes

**Use instead**:

- Quick Slack/email for trivial changes
- GitHub issue for bug fixes
- Lightweight spec for small projects

**PRDs make sense when**:

- Significant time investment (>1 week)
- Complex feature requiring clear specification
- Need documentation for future reference
- Building with AI coding tools like Claude Code

---

## Adapting Templates

Templates are starting points, not rigid structures.

**Adapt based on**:

- Company culture (startup vs enterprise)
- Product maturity (new product vs established)
- Team size (2 people vs 20)
- Audience (internal tool vs customer-facing)

**Good adaptation**:

- Removing sections that don't apply
- Adding sections for specific context
- Adjusting level of detail
- Changing format/structure

**Bad adaptation**:

- Removing problem statement (always needed)
- Skipping success metrics (always needed)
- No out-of-scope (always needed)
- Ignoring audience needs
