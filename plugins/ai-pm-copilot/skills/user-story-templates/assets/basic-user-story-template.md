## Guidance

### User Type/Persona

**Who** is the user?

**Good Examples**:

- "As a **free trial user**..."
- "As a **team administrator**..."
- "As a **mobile app user**..."
- "As a **first-time visitor**..."

**Bad Examples**:

- "As a **user**..." (too vague)
- "As **the system**..." (not a user)
- "As **we**..." (not user-focused)

### Action/Goal

**What** does the user want to do?

**Good Examples**:

- "...I want to **filter search results by date range**..."
- "...I want to **receive email notifications for mentions**..."
- "...I want to **bulk upload contacts from CSV**..."

**Bad Examples**:

- "...I want to **have a button**..." (describes UI, not goal)
- "...I want to **use the API**..." (describes implementation)
- "...I want **better performance**..." (too vague)

### Benefit/Value

**Why** does the user want this? What value does it provide?

**Good Examples**:

- "...so that **I can quickly find relevant information**"
- "...so that **I don't miss important updates**"
- "...so that **I can save time on data entry**"

**Bad Examples**:

- "...so that **the feature works**" (not a benefit)
- "...so that **it's implemented**" (tautological)
- Omitting "so that" clause entirely

## Example

As a small business owner
I want to export my invoices as PDF
So that I can send professional-looking invoices to clients
```

## Next Steps

Once you have your basic story:

1. Add acceptance criteria (see `acceptance-criteria-guide.md` in references/)
2. Verify it meets INVEST criteria (see `invest-criteria-guide.md`)
3. Estimate story points
4. Add to backlog and prioritize
