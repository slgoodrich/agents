- Descriptive of what the feature does
- Unique within backlog

### Acceptance Criteria
Include:

- **Performance**: Speed/load requirements
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation

### Definition of Done
Standard DoD for your team. Customize based on:

- **2**: Small (half day)
- **3**: Medium (1 day)
- **5**: Larger (2-3 days)
- **8**: Large (3-5 days) - consider splitting
