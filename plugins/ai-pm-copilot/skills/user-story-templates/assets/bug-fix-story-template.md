## Example: Payment Processing Bug

```
Title: Payment fails when using American Express cards

As a customer
I want to complete purchases using my American Express card
So that I can buy products without switching payment methods

Current Behavior:
When users enter American Express card details and click "Pay", the payment fails with error "Invalid card number" even though the card is valid.

Expected Behavior:
American Express cards should process successfully just like Visa/Mastercard.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add item to cart and proceed to checkout
2. Enter American Express card number: 378282246310005 (test card)
3. Enter valid expiry and CVV
4. Click "Pay Now"
5. Observe error: "Invalid card number"

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] American Express cards process successfully
- [ ] Test with multiple AmEx test cards (personal, corporate, international)
- [ ] Error no longer appears for valid AmEx cards
- [ ] Regression tests added for all card types (Visa, MC, AmEx, Discover)
- [ ] Fix verified in staging and production
- [ ] Root cause documented in tech spec

Environment:
- Browser: All browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox tested)
- Version: Production v2.3.1
- Payment gateway: Stripe

Severity: High
Impact: 15% of attempted transactions (AmEx market share), ~$5K/day in lost revenue
```

- **Specific**: "Payment fails with error 'Invalid card number' for AmEx cards"

### Steps to Reproduce
Make it easy for developers and QA to verify:
1. Use numbered steps
2. Be specific about actions
3. Include test data if applicable
4. Note the exact error or unexpected behavior

### Acceptance Criteria
For bugs, include:
- Bug fix verification
- Regression test coverage
- Related scenarios tested
- Root cause analysis
- Cross-environment verification

### Impact Assessment
Help prioritize by documenting:
- Number of users affected
- Revenue impact
- User experience degradation
- Workarounds available
- Competitive implications
