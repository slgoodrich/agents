## Example: Collaborative Album Epic

```markdown
# Epic: Collaborative Photo Albums

## Epic Goal
Enable users to create and share photo albums where multiple people can contribute photos.

## User Value
Users want to collect memories from events (weddings, trips, parties) where multiple people took photos. Currently they have to manually collect photos from everyone. Collaborative albums let everyone contribute directly, creating richer, more complete memory collections.

## Business Value
- **Engagement**: Increase weekly active users by 15% (collaborative features drive retention)
- **Viral growth**: Each shared album brings 2-3 new users on average
- **Premium upgrade**: 30% of collaborative album creators expected to upgrade to premium (unlimited albums)

## Success Criteria
- **Adoption**: 20% of active users create or contribute to collaborative album in first 3 months
- **Engagement**: Users with collaborative albums have 2x session length vs baseline
- **Viral coefficient**: 0.3 (each user invites 0.3 new users on average)
- **Premium conversion**: 10% of album creators upgrade within 30 days

- [ ] Week 1 metrics reviewed

## Out of Scope for v1
- Album templates or themes (future: make albums prettier)
- Comments on individual photos (future: enable discussion)
- Album moderation/reporting (future: handle abuse)
- Collaborative albums in mobile app (v1 is web-only)
- Merge/split albums (edge case, defer unless requested)
- Album analytics (who viewed, engagement stats)

## Timeline
- **Start**: Sprint 12 (June 1)

| Users spam invites (abuse) | Rate limit: max 50 invites/album, max 10 albums/day |
| Storage costs for shared albums | Monitor closely, consider premium-only for >500 photos/album |

## Guidance

### Epic vs Story

**Epic**: Large body of work that can be broken down (weeks/months)
**Story**: Small, deliverable increment of value (days)

**Signs you have an epic**:
- Takes more than 1 sprint
- Involves multiple team members
- Has multiple user workflows
- Requires multiple stories to deliver value

**Signs you have a story**:
- Can be completed in 1-5 days
- One developer can implement it
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Testable outcome

---

### Breaking Down Epics

**Common splitting strategies**:

1. **By workflow steps**: Create → Invite → Contribute → Manage
2. **By priority**: Must Have → Should Have → Nice to Have
3. **By user role**: Admin → Contributor → Viewer
4. **By CRUD**: Create → Read → Update → Delete
5. **By complexity**: Simple version → Advanced features

**Good breakdown**:
- Each story delivers some value independently
- Early stories enable later stories (dependencies clear)
- Stories can be developed in parallel where possible
- Critical path identified (what must be done first)

---

### Story Sequencing

Order matters. Consider:
1. **Dependencies**: What blocks what?
2. **Risk**: De-risk technical unknowns early
3. **Value**: Deliver highest value first
4. **Learning**: Get user feedback early
5. **Parallelization**: What can different devs work on simultaneously?

**Example sequence for Collaborative Albums**:
- Week 1: Story 1 (Create Album) - foundation
- Week 2: Stories 2 & 3 in parallel (Invite + Contribute) - core value
- Week 3: Story 4 (Real-time) - technical risk, start early
- Week 4: Story 5 (Permissions) - builds on invite
- Week 5-6: Stories 6 & 7 (Notifications, Activity) - polish

---

### Estimating Epics

**Bottom-up estimation**:
1. Break epic into stories
2. Estimate each story (story points or days)
3. Sum estimates
4. Add buffer (20-30% for unknowns)

**Top-down estimation** (before detailed breakdown):
- T-shirt sizes: S (2-3 weeks), M (1-2 months), L (2-3 months), XL (split it!)
- Fibonacci: 13, 21, 34, 55+ story points

**Example**: Collaborative Albums
- Story 1: 3 points
- Story 2: 5 points
- Story 3: 5 points
- Story 4: 8 points
- Story 5: 3 points
- Story 6: 5 points
- Story 7: 5 points
- **Total**: 34 points (~7 weeks at 5 points/week velocity)

---

### Epic Success Criteria

Define SMART metrics:
- **Specific**: "Increase engagement" → "Increase weekly active users by 15%"
- **Measurable**: Use numbers, percentages, concrete targets
- **Achievable**: Stretch but realistic based on data
- **Relevant**: Ties to business goals and user value
- **Time-bound**: "within 3 months of launch"

Track both:
- **Leading indicators**: Adoption rate, feature usage
- **Lagging indicators**: Retention, revenue impact

## When to Use This Template

Use when you have:
- Large feature that takes multiple sprints
- Complex workflow requiring many stories
- Major initiative requiring team alignment
- Need for executive-level visibility
- Multi-team coordination needed

For single-sprint work, skip epic and just create stories.
