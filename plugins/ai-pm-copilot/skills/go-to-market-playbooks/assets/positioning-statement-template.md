## The 5 Components

**1. Competitive Alternatives**
What do customers use today if not your product?

**2. Unique Attributes**
What do you have that alternatives don't?

**3. Value (Benefits)**
What value do those unique attributes enable?

**4. Target Customer**
Who cares most about that value?

**5. Market Category**
What context makes the value obvious?

## Positioning Process

**Step 1: List Competitive Alternatives**

```
Alternatives for Project Management Tool:
- Asana, Monday.com, Linear
- Spreadsheets
- Email + meetings
- Do nothing
```

**Step 2: Identify Unique Attributes**

```
What we have that they don't:
- AI-powered task prioritization
- Real-time async collaboration
- Built-in analytics dashboard
```

**Step 3: Map Attributes to Value**

```
AI prioritization -> Save 5 hours/week on planning
Async collaboration -> Works across timezones
Analytics -> Measure team productivity
```

**Step 4: Find Best-Fit Customer**

```
Who cares most?
- Remote-first startups (20-100 people)
- Product/engineering teams
- Fast-paced, data-driven culture
```

**Step 5: Choose Category**

```
Options:
A. "Project Management" (crowded)
B. "AI Productivity Platform" (new category)
C. "Team Operating System" (abstract)

Choice: B - Differentiated, clear value
```

## Positioning Statement Template

```
For [target customer]
Who [need/opportunity]
[Product] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [alternative]
We [primary differentiation]
```

**Example**:

```
For remote product teams at fast-growing startups
Who struggle with async collaboration and context switching
Acme is an AI-native team productivity platform
That automates busywork so teams ship faster
Unlike Asana or Monday which are just task trackers
We combine planning, collaboration, and intelligence in one tool
```
