## Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

```
Before: [Current pain]
After: [Desired state]
Bridge: [How product gets them there]
```

**Example**:

```
Before: "Teams waste 10 hours/week in status meetings"
After: "Imagine if everyone knew what's happening without meetings"
Bridge: "Our AI generates status updates automatically from your work"
```

## PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

```
Problem: [Identify pain]
Agitate: [Make it worse]
Solve: [Your solution]
```

**Example**:

```
Problem: "Your team is drowning in Slack messages"
Agitate: "You miss critical updates, decisions get lost, and new hires can't find context"
Solve: "Acme organizes all team knowledge automatically"
```
