## Positioning

Use April Dunford's 5-component framework:

1. **Competitive Alternatives** - What customers use today
2. **Unique Attributes** - What you have that alternatives don't
3. **Value** - What those attributes enable
4. **Target Customer** - Who cares most about that value
5. **Market Category** - What context makes the value obvious

**Positioning Statement Template**:

```
For [target customer]
Who [need/opportunity]
[Product] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [alternative]
We [primary differentiation]
```

> **Deep dive**: See [assets/positioning-statement-template.md](assets/positioning-statement-template.md) for the full 5-step positioning process with worked examples.

---

## Messaging

Three-level messaging hierarchy:

- **Level 1**: Company messaging (mission, brand, values)
- **Level 2**: Product messaging (positioning, value props, differentiators)
- **Level 3**: Feature messaging (benefits, use cases, proof points)

Key formulas:

- **Before-After-Bridge (BAB)**: Pain -> desired state -> how product bridges the gap
- **PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)**: Identify pain -> make it worse -> your solution

> **Deep dive**: See [assets/messaging-formulas-template.md](assets/messaging-formulas-template.md) for full formulas with examples.

## Launch Strategy

### Launch Tiers

**Tier 1: Major Launch** - New product, major rebranding, strategic pivot. Full PR, events, marketing.

**Tier 2: Feature Launch** - Significant new capability. Blog post, email, social, targeted outreach.

**Tier 3: Improvement** - Bug fixes, small features. Release notes, changelog.

### Launch Channels

| Channel Type     | Examples                                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owned**        | Website, blog, email list, in-app, social media                  |

## Market Entry Strategy

### TAM/SAM/SOM

```
TAM (Total Addressable Market): Everyone who could use product
SAM (Serviceable Available Market): Segment you can reach
SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): Realistic target
```

### Beachhead Strategy (Geoffrey Moore)

Dominate one narrow segment before expanding.

1. **Identify Beachhead**: Narrow, winnable segment
2. **Dominate**: Become #1 in that segment
3. **Expand**: Adjacent segments

Examples: Facebook (Harvard -> Ivy League -> all colleges -> everyone), Amazon (books -> electronics -> everything)

### Market Entry Checklist

- [ ] Market size validation
- [ ] Competitive landscape
- [ ] Regulatory requirements
- [ ] Localization needs (language, currency, compliance)
- [ ] Distribution partners
- [ ] Pricing for market

## Competitive Strategy

### Competitive Intel

**What to Track**: Product features/roadmap, pricing, marketing messages, customer reviews, funding/news

**Sources**: Competitor websites/blogs, G2/Capterra reviews, LinkedIn (hiring = roadmap hints), earnings calls, customer conversations

### Battle Cards

For each competitor, document:

- Overview (size, funding, target customers, strengths)
- When they win vs. when we win
- Feature comparison and positioning
- Objection handling scripts
- Proof points (customer wins, case studies)

---

## Pricing & Packaging

Five core pricing models: Freemium, Free Trial, Usage-Based, Tiered, Per-Seat.

Pick a value metric that scales with customer value (per user, per event, per API call, storage).

> **Deep dive**: See [references/pricing-packaging-guide.md](references/pricing-packaging-guide.md) for pricing model details and 3-tier packaging strategy.
