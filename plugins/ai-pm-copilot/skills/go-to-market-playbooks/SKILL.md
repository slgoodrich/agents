## Positioning Framework (April Dunford)

### The 5 Components

**1. Competitive Alternatives**
What do customers use today if not your product?

**2. Unique Attributes**
What do you have that alternatives don't?

**3. Value (Benefits)**
What value do those unique attributes enable?

**4. Target Customer**
Who cares most about that value?

**5. Market Category**
What context makes the value obvious?

---

### Positioning Process

**Step 1: List Competitive Alternatives**
```
Alternatives for Project Management Tool:
- Asana, Monday.com, Linear
- Spreadsheets
- Email + meetings
- Do nothing
```

**Step 2: Identify Unique Attributes**
```
What we have that they don't:
- AI-powered task prioritization
- Real-time async collaboration
- Built-in analytics dashboard
```

**Step 3: Map Attributes to Value**
```
AI prioritization → Save 5 hours/week on planning
Async collaboration → Works across timezones
Analytics → Measure team productivity
```

**Step 4: Find Best-Fit Customer**
```
Who cares most?
- Remote-first startups (20-100 people)
- Product/engineering teams
- Fast-paced, data-driven culture
```

**Step 5: Choose Category**
```
Options:
A. "Project Management" (crowded)
B. "AI Productivity Platform" (new category)
C. "Team Operating System" (abstract)

Choice: B - Differentiated, clear value
```

---

### Positioning Statement Template

```
For [target customer]
Who [need/opportunity]
[Product] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [alternative]
We [primary differentiation]
```

**Example**:
```
For remote product teams at fast-growing startups
Who struggle with async collaboration and context switching
Acme is an AI-native team productivity platform
That automates busywork so teams ship faster
Unlike Asana or Monday which are just task trackers
We combine planning, collaboration, and intelligence in one tool
```

## Messaging Hierarchy

### Structure

**Level 1: Company Messaging**
- Mission/vision
- Brand positioning
- Core values

**Level 2: Product Messaging**
- Product positioning
- Value propositions
- Key differentiators

**Level 3: Feature Messaging**

- Use cases
- Proof points

---

### Messaging Formulas

**Before-After-Bridge (BAB)**
```
Before: [Current pain]
After: [Desired state]
Bridge: [How product gets them there]

Example:
Before: "Teams waste 10 hours/week in status meetings"
After: "Imagine if everyone knew what's happening without meetings"
Bridge: "Our AI generates status updates automatically from your work"
```

**PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)**
```
Problem: [Identify pain]
Agitate: [Make it worse]
Solve: [Your solution]

Example:
Problem: "Your team is drowning in Slack messages"
Agitate: "You miss critical updates, decisions get lost, and new hires can't find context"
Solve: "Acme organizes all team knowledge automatically"
```
