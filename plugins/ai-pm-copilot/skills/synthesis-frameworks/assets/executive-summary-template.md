## Example: Executive Summary

**Project:** Onboarding Usability Study
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Researcher:** Product Research team

### Research Goals

- Understand where users struggle in onboarding flow
- Identify friction points causing abandonment
- Validate new onboarding design concepts

### Methodology

**Participants:** 10 new users (mix of solo founders and small teams)
**Format:** 45-minute remote usability tests via Zoom
**Dates:** October 15-22, 2025
**Approach:** Think-aloud protocol testing current onboarding + concept validation

### Key Findings

**1. "Invite Team" step causes 60% abandonment**
Evidence: 8/10 users attempted to skip, average 45 seconds stuck on step
Recommendation: Make step optional with "Skip for now" + email reminder on Day 3

**2. Users don't understand value prop until step 4**
Evidence: 7/10 asked "What does this tool actually do?" during setup
Recommendation: Show example workspace/demo content earlier in flow

**3. Password requirements frustrate without clear indication**
Evidence: All 10 users failed first password attempt, 3 nearly abandoned
Recommendation: Add real-time validation with helpful error messages

**4. Users expect single sign-on options**
Evidence: 6/10 looked for Google/GitHub login, 4 explicitly asked for it
Recommendation: Add OAuth options (prioritize Google + GitHub)

**5. Mobile experience is non-functional**
Evidence: 2/10 tried on mobile first, both abandoned and switched to desktop
Recommendation: Either build mobile-responsive onboarding or block mobile with "Desktop required" message

### Recommendations

**Quick Wins (Do First):**

1. Make "Invite Team" optional (Low effort, High impact: potentially 2x activation)
2. Add real-time password validation (Low effort, Medium impact: reduce frustration)

**Strategic Improvements (Do Next):**

1. Add OAuth sign-in options (Medium effort, High impact: reduce friction + improve perception)
2. Show value earlier with example content (Medium effort, High impact: improve understanding)

**Future Considerations:**

- Mobile onboarding experience (Large effort, requires mobile strategy decision first)
- Personalized onboarding based on user role

### Next Steps

**Immediate actions:**

- Engineering: Implement "Skip for now" button (Owner: Sarah, Timeline: This sprint)
- Product: Design OAuth flow (Owner: Marcus, Timeline: Next sprint)
- Research: Test new onboarding flow once changes shipped (Timeline: 3 weeks)

**Follow-up research:**

- Longitudinal study: Track activation rates post-changes
- Concept testing: Validate OAuth flow design before build
