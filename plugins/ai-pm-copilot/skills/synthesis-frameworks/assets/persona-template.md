# Persona Template

Data-driven persona format for creating user archetypes based on research synthesis.

## Creating Personas from Research

### Process

**1. Identify Behavioral Patterns**

- How do users differ in behaviors?
- What are their distinct goals and motivations?
- What workflows do they follow?

**2. Cluster Users**

- Group users with similar patterns
- 3-5 distinct clusters is typical
- Look for meaningful differences (not superficial demographics)

**3. Define Persona Archetypes**

- Name each cluster (memorable, alliterative names help)
- Create representative profile for each
- Base on real data, not assumptions

**4. Validate**

- Do real users fit into these archetypes?
- Are the differences meaningful for product decisions?
- Can the team use these for decision-making?

## Persona Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Demographics without behavior:**
Don't create personas based only on age/gender/location. Focus on behaviors and goals.

**Too many personas:**
More than 5 personas becomes unmanageable. Focus on the most distinct and important segments.

**Marketing personas:**
Product personas differ from marketing personas. Focus on product usage, not buyer journey.

**Fake personas:**
Base on real research data, not assumptions or "we think users are like..."

**Decorative personas:**
If the team doesn't use personas to make decisions, they're just decoration. Make them actionable.

## Using Personas Effectively

**In product decisions:**
"Would Power-User Paula care about this feature? What about Onboarding Olivia?"

**In design reviews:**
"Is this navigation clear for Onboarding Olivia, or only obvious to Power-User Paula?"

**In prioritization:**
"This feature solves a problem for Paula but not Olivia. What's our priority?"

**In roadmap planning:**
"Q1 focused on Paula's needs. Q2 let's address Olivia's onboarding issues."
