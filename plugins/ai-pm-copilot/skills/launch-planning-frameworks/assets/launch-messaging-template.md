# Launch Messaging Template

Framework for creating clear, compelling positioning and messaging for product launches.

---

## Positioning Statement

**Template** (Geoffrey Moore's format):

```
For [target customer]
Who [customer need/pain]
[Product name] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [competitors/alternatives]
We [unique differentiation]
```

### Example: Slack Calls

```
For remote teams
Who need quick synchronous collaboration without context switching
Slack Calls is a built-in voice/video feature
That enables instant face-to-face connection
Unlike scheduling Zoom meetings or switching to another app
We make it effortless to go from chat to call in one click
```

---

## Message Hierarchy

### Level 1: Headline (8-12 words)

**Purpose**: Grab attention, communicate core value instantly

**Formula**: [Action Verb] + [Outcome] + [Speed/Ease Modifier]

**Examples**:

- "Ship features 2x faster with continuous deployment"
- "Your team's knowledge, organized and instantly searchable"
- "Analytics that actually help you make better decisions"
- "Turn customer feedback into product improvements in minutes"

**Test**: Can someone repeat this after hearing it once?

---

### Level 2: Subhead (20-30 words)

**Purpose**: Expand on headline, clarify specific value

**Formula**: [How it works] + [Primary benefit] + [Result]

**Example**:

```
Headline: Ship features 2x faster with continuous deployment

Subhead: Our platform automatically tests and deploys your code, reducing
release cycles from weeks to hours while maintaining quality and safety.
```

---

### Level 3: Key Messages (3-5 bullets)

**Purpose**: Core value propositions, each standing alone

**Formula per message**: [Benefit headline] + [Specific proof point]

**Example**:

```
Feature: Advanced Analytics Dashboard

Key Messages:
1. Deploy 10x faster: Push to production in minutes, not weeks
2. Zero-downtime releases: Deploy anytime without impacting customers
3. Built-in safety: Automated testing catches issues before they reach production
4. Complete visibility: Track every deployment with real-time dashboards
5. Team confidence: Deploy on Fridays without fear
```

**Guidelines**:

- Each message = one value proposition
- Use numbers when possible
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Customer language, not jargon

---

### Level 4: Proof Points

**Purpose**: Back up key messages with evidence

**Types of proof**:

- Statistics ("99.99% uptime across 10M deployments")
- Customer quotes ("Reduced time-to-market by 60%" - Engineering Lead, Acme Corp)
- Case studies (Link to customer story)
- Usage stats ("2,000+ companies deploy daily")
- Awards/recognition ("Gartner Leader in CD tools 2024")

**Example**:

```
Key Message: Deploy 10x faster

Proof Points:
- Average deployment time: 8 minutes (vs 2 weeks industry average)
- 2,000+ companies ship multiple times per day
- "We went from monthly releases to daily deployments" - CTO, TechCo
- 10M+ successful deployments across our platform
```

## Complete Messaging Example

### Feature: Collaborative Photo Albums

**Positioning**:

```
For families and friend groups
Who want to collect and share memories from shared events
Collaborative Albums is a photo-sharing feature
That lets multiple people contribute photos to one shared collection
Unlike manually collecting photos via text or email
We make it automatic and real-time - everyone's photos in one place
```

**Message Hierarchy**:

**Headline**: Collect everyone's photos from your event in one place

**Subhead**: Create a shared album, invite your friends and family, and watch as everyone's photos appear automatically in real-time.

**Key Messages**:

1. **No more asking for photos**: Everyone can add their photos directly
2. **Real-time magic**: See photos appear as people upload them
3. **Relive together**: Comment and react to shared memories
4. **Beautifully organized**: All event photos in one stunning collection

**Proof Points**:

- 10K+ collaborative albums created in beta
- Average album has 8 contributors and 200 photos
- "This made our wedding album 10x better - everyone's perspective!" - Sarah M.
- Photos appear within seconds of upload (real-time sync)

## Messaging By Audience

Different audiences need different framing:

### For End Users (Benefits)

```
Headline: Never lose track of shared memories
Focus: Convenience, joy, connection
Language: Emotional, personal, simple
Example: "See everyone's perspective from your trip"
```

### For Decision Makers (ROI)

```
Headline: Increase user engagement by 30% with collaborative features
Focus: Metrics, business value, competitive advantage
Language: Data-driven, strategic
Example: "Users with collaborative albums have 2x session time"
```

### For Technical Audience (How)

```
Headline: Real-time photo sync powered by WebSockets
Focus: Architecture, technology, implementation
Language: Technical, specific
Example: "Sub-second sync using WebSocket + eventual consistency"
```

---

## Value Proposition Formula

**[Target Customer] + [Problem] + [Solution] + [Differentiation]**

**Examples**:

**Weak**: "We have great analytics"
**Strong**: "Marketing teams struggling with disconnected data get unified dashboards that show real ROI, unlike basic tools that only track vanity metrics"

**Weak**: "Fast deployment tool"
**Strong**: "Dev teams tired of manual, error-prone releases get automated deployments with one-click rollback, unlike complex CI/CD tools requiring weeks of setup"

---

## Messaging Principles

**DO**:

- Start with customer pain
- Use specific numbers
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Use customer language
- Show, don't just tell
- Address "why now?"

**DON'T**:

- Lead with features
- Use industry jargon
- Make generic claims
- Bury the benefit
- Forget the alternative (what they do today)

---

## Messaging Testing

Before finalizing, test messaging with:

**5-second test**: Can someone explain the value after seeing headline for 5 seconds?

**Elevator pitch test**: Can you explain it in 30 seconds?

**Customer reaction test**: Show to 3-5 customers. Do they "get it" immediately?

**Competitive test**: Is it clearly different from competitors?

**Excitement test**: Does it make people want to try it?
