## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

For each risk, assess **likelihood** and **impact**:

**Risk 1**: [Describe risk]
- Likelihood: High / Medium / Low
- Impact: High / Medium / Low
- Mitigation: [How we'll handle it]

**Risk 2**: [Describe risk]
- Likelihood: High / Medium / Low
- Impact: High / Medium / Low
- Mitigation: [How we'll handle it]

**Risk 3**: [Describe risk]
- Likelihood: High / Medium / Low
- Impact: High / Medium / Low
- Mitigation: [How we'll handle it]

**Critical risks** (High likelihood + High impact):
- [ ] None
- [ ] [List critical risks and whether they're acceptable]

## Readiness Scores

Rate each function 1-5:
- 1 = Not ready at all
- 3 = Somewhat ready, have concerns
- 5 = Fully ready and confident

| Function | Score (1-5) | Concerns |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Product/Engineering | [ ] / 5 | [Note concerns] |
| Marketing | [ ] / 5 | [Note concerns] |
| Sales | [ ] / 5 | [Note concerns] |
| Customer Success | [ ] / 5 | [Note concerns] |
| Support | [ ] / 5 | [Note concerns] |

**Average Score**: [ ] / 5

**Threshold for GO**:
- All teams ≥ 4 = GO
- Any team < 3 = NO-GO
- Any team = 3 = CONDITIONAL GO (watch closely)

---

## Launch Confidence Poll

Each attendee votes:

**Confidence in launch success** (1-5 scale):
- 5 = Very confident, will be great
- 4 = Confident, minor concerns
- 3 = Neutral, could go either way
- 2 = Not confident, significant concerns
- 1 = Not confident at all, shouldn't launch

| Name | Confidence | Main Concern |
|------|------------|--------------|
| [PM] | [ ] / 5 | [Note] |
| [Eng Lead] | [ ] / 5 | [Note] |
| [Marketing] | [ ] / 5 | [Note] |
| [Sales] | [ ] / 5 | [Note] |
| [CS] | [ ] / 5 | [Note] |
| [Support] | [ ] / 5 | [Note] |
| [Exec] | [ ] / 5 | [Note] |

**Average**: [ ] / 5

**Threshold**: Average ≥ 4 = GO | Average < 3 = NO-GO

---

## Decision Framework

```
IF (All Must-Have Criteria = YES)
  AND (No Critical Risks)
  AND (Average Readiness ≥ 4)
  AND (Average Confidence ≥ 4)
THEN → GO

ELSE → Evaluate delay
```

## Historical Context

**Past Go/No-Go Decisions** (for learning):

| Launch | Date | Decision | Outcome | Learnings |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| [Feature X] | [Date] | GO | Success | [What went well] |
| [Feature Y] | [Date] | NO-GO (delayed 2 weeks) | Success after delay | [Why delay was right call] |
| [Feature Z] | [Date] | GO (with risks) | Issues on launch day | [What we should have delayed for] |

**Key Learnings**:
- When in doubt, delay
- Quality > timeline
- Team confidence matters
- Better to launch great 1 week late than launch broken on time

---

**Key Principle**: The go/no-go decision protects the team, the company, and customers. It's not about hitting a date at all costs - it's about launching successfully. A delayed launch that succeeds is better than an on-time launch that fails.
