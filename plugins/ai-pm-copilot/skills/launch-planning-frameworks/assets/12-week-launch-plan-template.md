## Adapting This Template

**For Tier 2 (6-week plan)**:

- Condense Weeks 12-10 into Week 6 (strategy)
- Condense Weeks 9-7 into Weeks 5-4 (content)
- Condense Weeks 6-4 into Week 3 (enablement)
- Keep Weeks 3-1 similar (final prep)

**For Tier 3 (2-week plan)**:

- Week 2: Strategy + content creation
- Week 1: Final prep + launch
- Day 1: Launch
- Week 1 post: Metrics + feedback

---

**Key Principle**: This timeline is a framework, not a religion. Adjust based on your product, company size, and launch tier. The goal is coordination and preparedness, not perfect adherence to dates.
