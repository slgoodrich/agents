- Track channel performance

**DON'T**:
- Spam customers with too many emails
- Forget to inform internal teams first
- Over-promise in external messaging
- Launch on Friday (no support over weekend)
- Send email without testing
- Ignore negative feedback

**Key Principle**: Meet customers where they are. Not every channel works for every audience. Focus on channels where your target customers actually spend time.
