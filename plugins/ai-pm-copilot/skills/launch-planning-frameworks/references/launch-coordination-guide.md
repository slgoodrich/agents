## Communication Patterns

### For Solo Operators / Small Teams

If you don't have separate marketing, sales, CS teams:

**You own it all**:

- Write launch brief yourself
- Create simple landing page
- Write blog post + email
- Enable yourself (know how to demo)
- Plan customer communication
- Set up basic support FAQ

**Simplify**:

- Skip press release (unless Tier 1)
- Skip elaborate sales training (it's just you)
- Focus on: positioning, website, email, blog
- Use templates aggressively

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks is plenty for Tier 1 solo launch

### RACI Matrix

Use RACI to clarify who does what:

| Activity            | PM  | Marketing | Sales | CS  | Eng | Support |
| ------------------- | --- | --------- | ----- | --- | --- | ------- |
| **Positioning**     | A   | R         | C     | C   | I   | I       |
| **Website Copy**    | C   | R,A       | I     | I   | I   | I       |
| **Blog Post**       | R,A | R         | I     | I   | I   | I       |
| **Sales Deck**      | C   | C         | R,A   | I   | I   | I       |
| **Customer Email**  | R,A | C         | I     | R   | I   | I       |
| **Support Runbook** | C   | I         | I     | C   | C   | R,A     |
| **Deployment**      | A   | I         | I     | I   | R   | I       |

**Legend**:

- **R**: Responsible (does the work)
- **A**: Accountable (makes decisions, approves)
- **C**: Consulted (provides input)
- **I**: Informed (kept in the loop)

## Common Coordination Challenges

### Challenge 1: Misaligned Timelines

**Symptom**: Marketing needs 8 weeks, engineering says 2 weeks

**Solution**:

- Align on launch tier early
- Set timeline based on tier
- Engineering works backward from launch date
- Marketing plans forward from kickoff

---

### Challenge 2: Unclear Ownership

**Symptom**: "I thought you were doing that"

**Solution**:

- RACI matrix for every deliverable
- Weekly status checks
- Written action items with owners

---

### Challenge 4: Last-Minute Surprises

**Symptom**: "We can't launch, X isn't ready"

**Solution**:

- Weekly go/no-go checkpoints
- Surface risks early and often
- No surprises at T-1 week
- Clear escalation path

---

## Escalation Framework

**When to escalate**:

- Blocker with no clear resolution
- Cross-functional disagreement
- Resource constraint
- Timeline risk
- Quality/stability concern

**How to escalate**:

1. Document the issue clearly
2. Present options with trade-offs
3. Recommend a path
4. Escalate to exec sponsor
5. Get decision
6. Communicate broadly

---

## Launch Communication Cadence

### 8 Weeks Before

- Kickoff meeting
- Weekly syncs start

### 4 Weeks Before

- Increase sync frequency (2x/week if needed)
- Begin enablement sessions

### 2 Weeks Before

- Daily check-ins (async or standup)
- Readiness review meeting

### 1 Week Before

- Go/no-go decision
- Final prep daily standups

### Launch Day

- War room (continuous)
- Hourly check-ins

### Post-Launch Week 1

- Daily metrics review
- Issue triage meetings

---

**Key Principle**: Over-communicate. In launches, nobody ever complained about too much communication. They complain about surprises.
