## Overview

April Dunford's positioning framework from "Obviously Awesome" (2019) provides a systematic process for creating product positioning that makes your unique value obvious to customers.

**Key Innovation**: Positioning is context that helps customers understand what your product is, why it's special, and why they should care.

**Origin**: Evolved from 20+ years as VP Marketing/CMO at multiple startups, specifically focused on positioning products in competitive markets.

## The Positioning Components (What You Need to Define)

Before diving into the process, understand the six components every positioning must define:

### 1. Competitive Alternatives

What customers would do if your product didn't exist

### 2. Unique Attributes

Capabilities you have that alternatives don't

### 3. Value (and Proof)

Why customers care about your unique attributes

### 4. Target Market Characteristics

Who cares most about your value

### 5. Market Category

The mental box customers put you in

### 6. Relevant Trends

Market forces that make your product timely

**Critical Insight**: These must be defined IN ORDER. Each builds on the previous.

---

## The 10-Step Positioning Process

### Step 1: Understand the Customers Who Love Your Product

**Goal**: Identify your "best fit" customers before positioning

**Why Start Here**: You can't position for everyone. Start with customers who get disproportionate value.

**What to Do**:

1. Identify 10-15 customers who LOVE your product
2. Interview them: Why did you buy? What value do you get? What alternatives did you consider?
3. Look for patterns: What do these customers have in common?

**Output**: Customer profiles of your best customers

**Example**: Superhuman found their best customers were executives/VCs with 100+ emails/day who valued time over cost.

**Anti-Pattern**: Skipping this step and positioning for "everyone" or hypothetical customers.

---

### Step 2: Form a Positioning Team

**Goal**: Get cross-functional input for complete picture

**Why**: Different teams see different aspects of value and competition

**Who to Include**:

- **Product/Founder**: Product vision and strategy
- **Sales**: Frontline competitive insights
- **Marketing**: Market and category understanding
- **Customer Success**: Usage patterns and value realization
- **Engineering** (optional): Technical differentiation

**Team Size**: 4-8 people ideal (more than 10 gets unwieldy)

**Time Commitment**: 3-4 hours together (can be 2-3 sessions)

**Output**: Assembled team ready for positioning exercise

---

### Step 3: Align Positioning Vocabulary and Product Knowledge

**Goal**: Ensure everyone understands the product the same way

**Why**: Misaligned product understanding leads to misaligned positioning

**What to Do**:

1. **Demo the product**: Walk through key features and use cases
2. **Review capabilities**: List everything the product can do
3. **Align on terminology**: Agree on how to describe features
4. **Share context**: Product roadmap, strategy, target market hypotheses

**Output**: Shared understanding of what the product is and does

**Time**: 30-45 minutes

**Tip**: Don't skip this even if team thinks they know the product. Misalignment is common.

---

### Step 4: List Your True Competitive Alternatives

**Goal**: Identify what customers would do if you didn't exist

**Key Insight**: Competitive alternatives ≠ Competitors

**Questions to Ask**:

- What did customers use before you?
- What would they use if you shut down tomorrow?
- What status quo are you disrupting?

**Process**:

1. Brainstorm alternatives (not just competitors)
2. Include "do nothing" if relevant
3. Include manual processes (spreadsheets, email, etc.)
4. Prioritize the top 2-3 most common alternatives

**Examples**:

- **Slack**: Alternative was email (not just other chat tools)
- **Uber**: Alternative was calling a cab or driving (not just Lyft)
- **Superhuman**: Alternative was dealing with slow email in Gmail (not just other email clients)

**Output**: List of 2-4 competitive alternatives (not competitors)

**Anti-Pattern**: Listing feature-similar products instead of true customer alternatives

---

### Step 5: Isolate Your Unique Attributes

**Goal**: Identify capabilities you have that alternatives don't

**Key Insight**: Unique ≠ Features. Unique = Meaningfully different from alternatives.

**Process**:

1. List all your features and capabilities
2. For each feature, ask: "Do competitive alternatives have this?"
3. Keep only what alternatives DON'T have
4. Group related capabilities into themes

**Example (Slack vs. Email)**:

- ❌ Searchable history (email has this)
- ❌ File sharing (email has this)
- ✓ Real-time group messaging (email doesn't)
- ✓ Persistent channels organized by topic (email folders aren't the same)
- ✓ Deep integrations with 2,000+ tools (email has limited integrations)

**Output**: 3-5 unique attributes that alternatives lack

**Anti-Pattern**: Listing features competitors also have, or listing too many (>7) attributes

**Facilitation Tip**: This step gets contentious ("But our feature IS unique!"). Stay strict: compared to alternatives, is it unique?

---

### Step 6: Map Attributes to Value Themes

**Goal**: Translate unique attributes into customer value

**Key Insight**: Customers don't care about features, they care about outcomes.

**Process**:

1. For each unique attribute, ask: "Why do customers care about this?"
2. Group attributes that deliver similar value
3. Name the value theme
4. Gather proof (customer quotes, metrics, case studies)

**Framework**:

```
Unique Attribute → Benefit → Value Theme → Proof
```

**Example (Slack)**:

**Unique Attributes → Value**:

- Real-time messaging → Faster decisions → **Speed** → "Cut meeting time 50%"
- Persistent channels → Preserved context → **Transparency** → "New hires onboard in 3 days vs 2 weeks"
- Deep integrations → Centralized workflow → **Productivity** → "Reduced tool sprawl from 12 apps to 5"

**Output**: 2-4 value themes, each supported by unique attributes and proof

**Anti-Pattern**: Attribute → Feature description without connecting to customer outcome

---

### Step 7: Determine Who Cares a Lot About Your Value

**Goal**: Identify the specific segment that gets disproportionate value

**Key Insight**: Not everyone values your differentiation equally. Find the segment that cares most.

**Segmentation Criteria**:

- **Demographics**: Company size, industry, role, geography
- **Psychographics**: Values, priorities, risk tolerance
- **Behavioral**: Usage patterns, tech adoption, buying behavior
- **Situational**: Specific pain points, timing, triggers

**Process**:

1. Review "best fit" customers from Step 1
2. Identify characteristics they share
3. Define segment(s) that care most about your value themes
4. Validate: Does this segment have the problem acutely? Will they pay for the value?

**Example (Superhuman)**:

- **Broad Market**: Anyone with email (2 billion people)
- **Target Market**: Executives/VCs managing 100+ emails/day who value time > cost
- **Why**: High-volume email users get most value from speed optimizations ($30/month is irrelevant to execs saving hours)

**Output**: Specific target market description (not "everyone")

**Anti-Pattern**:

- Target market too broad ("small businesses")
- Target market defined by product ("companies that need CRM")
- Target market with no common characteristics

**Best Practice**: Describe your best 10 customers. What do they have in common? That's your target market.

---

### Step 8: Find a Market Category That Makes Your Value Obvious

**Goal**: Choose the mental box customers put you in

**Key Insight**: Category sets expectations about what you do, who you compete with, and what you should cost.

**Why Category Matters**:

- Customers evaluate products within a category
- Category determines who your competitors are
- Category sets pricing expectations
- Category defines required features ("table stakes")

**Category Options**:

**1. Existing Category (Lowest Risk)**

- **Pros**: Customers understand it, market exists, clear expectations
- **Cons**: Established competitors, price expectations, feature expectations
- **Example**: Zoom in "video conferencing"

**2. Adjacent Category (Medium Risk)**

- **Pros**: Related to known category, some understanding
- **Cons**: May need education, positioning may confuse
- **Example**: Superhuman as "fast email" (not productivity tool)

**3. Subcategory (Medium Risk)**

- **Pros**: Narrow existing category to own a niche
- **Cons**: May limit market perception
- **Example**: "Email for power users" (subset of email)

**4. Create New Category (Highest Risk)**

- **Pros**: Own the category, set expectations, no direct competitors
- **Cons**: Requires market education, expensive, may not stick
- **Example**: Salesforce creating "No Software" / Cloud CRM

**Selection Criteria**:

1. **Does it make your value obvious?** If customer hears category, do they understand why you're better?
2. **Does it set you up to win?** Does category favor your strengths?
3. **Is it credible?** Will customers believe you belong in this category?

**Process**:

1. Brainstorm category options (existing, adjacent, new)
2. For each category, test: Does it make our unique value obvious?
3. Choose category that best highlights your differentiation

**Example**:

- **Bad**: Slack as "enterprise communication" (vague, doesn't explain value)
- **Good**: Slack as "team messaging" (clear alternative to email, value obvious)

**Output**: Market category that makes your unique value obvious

**Anti-Pattern**:

- Choosing category that doesn't fit your capabilities
- Creating new category without budget to educate market
- Vague category that doesn't set clear expectations

---

### Step 9: Layer on Trends (Carefully)

**Goal**: Connect product to relevant market forces that make it timely

**Key Insight**: Trends are icing, not cake. Only add if genuinely relevant.

**Trend Types**:

- **Technology**: AI, mobile, cloud, blockchain
- **Regulatory**: GDPR, data privacy, compliance
- **Social**: Remote work, creator economy, sustainability
- **Economic**: Recession, inflation, market shifts

**When to Use Trends**:

- Trend genuinely makes your product more relevant
- You can credibly claim trend alignment
- Trend will last long enough to matter (not fad)

**When NOT to Use Trends**:

- Forcing buzzwords that don't apply ("AI-powered" everything)
- Trend is unrelated to your core value
- Trend is hype with no substance

**Examples**:

- **Zoom (2020)**: Remote work trend makes video conferencing critical ✓
- **Notion (2019)**: Remote collaboration trend drives need for shared workspace ✓
- **Random SaaS**: "Blockchain-enabled CRM" (blockchain adds no value) ✗

**Test**: Would your positioning be worse without the trend? If no, don't include it.

**Output**: 0-2 relevant trends (often zero is best)

**Anti-Pattern**: Trend-stuffing to sound innovative ("AI-powered, blockchain-enabled, cloud-native platform")

---

### Step 10: Capture Your Positioning in a Document

**Goal**: Document positioning for company-wide alignment

**Why Document**: Positioning only works if consistently applied across all teams.

**What to Include**:

**1. Positioning Summary** (1 page):

- Target market
- Competitive alternatives
- Unique attributes
- Value themes
- Market category
- Relevant trends (if any)

**2. Positioning Statement** (1 paragraph):
Use one of the standard formats (see positioning-statement-template.md)

**3. Proof Points** (1 page):

- Customer quotes
- Metrics and case studies
- Supporting evidence for each value theme

**4. Positioning FAQs** (1-2 pages):

- Why this target market?
- Why this category?
- How do we compare to [competitor]?
- What about [other segment]?

**Output**: Positioning document shared with entire company

**Distribution**:

- Share with all teams (product, marketing, sales, CS, engineering)
- Present in all-hands or company meeting
- Reference in onboarding for new hires
- Update quarterly or when positioning changes

**Anti-Pattern**: Positioning document that sits in folder and nobody uses

**Best Practice**:

- Make it accessible (wiki, shared doc)
- Train teams on how to use it
- Reference it in key meetings
- Update regularly

- Launching new product
- Major feature additions
- Entering new market
- Competition shifts significantly
- Win/loss rates change

---

## Why This Order Matters

**Steps 4-8 MUST be done in sequence**:

**4 → 5**: You can't identify unique attributes until you know what you're comparing to (alternatives)

**5 → 6**: You can't articulate value until you know what's unique about you (attributes)

**6 → 7**: You can't identify target market until you know what value you deliver (value themes)

**7 → 8**: You can't choose category until you know who you're positioning for (target market)

**Common Mistake**: Jumping to category or target market first, then trying to reverse-engineer positioning.

## Real-World Example: Applying the Framework

### Example: Project Management SaaS

**Step 4: Competitive Alternatives**

- Alternative 1: Spreadsheets + email
- Alternative 2: Jira (for dev teams)
- Alternative 3: Asana (for general teams)

**Step 5: Unique Attributes**

- Time tracking built into every task
- Client portal for external visibility
- Automated invoicing based on time tracked
- Project profitability dashboard

**Step 6: Value Themes**

- **Profitability**: Know which projects make money → "Increase project profitability by 30%"
- **Client transparency**: Clients see progress without meetings → "Reduce status update meetings 50%"
- **Billing accuracy**: No more manual timesheet → invoice translation → "Bill 100% of time worked"

**Step 7: Target Market**

- Agencies (design, dev, consulting) with 5-50 people
- Client services model (billable hours)
- Struggle with project profitability visibility

**Step 8: Market Category**

- "Agency project management" (subcategory of project management)
- Makes clear: Built for agencies, not generic PM

**Step 9: Trends**

- Remote work (distributed teams need better visibility) ✓
- Economic uncertainty (agencies need profitability focus) ✓

**Step 10: Positioning Document**

```
For agencies (5-50 people) running client projects on billable hours
Who struggle to understand project profitability
[Product] is agency project management software
That tracks time, shows profitability, and bills clients automatically
Unlike generic PM tools (Asana) or spreadsheets
We give you real-time profitability visibility and automate billing
```

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Skipping Customer Research (Step 1)

**Problem**: Positioning for hypothetical customers, not real ones

**Fix**: Interview 10-15 customers who love your product before positioning

### Mistake 2: Doing Steps Out of Order

**Problem**: Choosing category first, then trying to force positioning to fit

**Fix**: Follow steps 4-8 in sequence. Each builds on previous.

### Mistake 3: Too Many Unique Attributes

**Problem**: Listing 10+ attributes makes positioning unfocused

**Fix**: Limit to 3-5 truly unique attributes. Group related capabilities.

### Mistake 4: Vague Target Market

**Problem**: "Small businesses" or "anyone who needs [X]"

**Fix**: Specific segment with shared characteristics. Describe your best 10 customers.

### Mistake 5: Wrong Category

**Problem**: Category doesn't make unique value obvious

**Fix**: Test category against value themes. Does category help or hurt understanding?

### Mistake 6: Trend-Stuffing

**Problem**: "AI-powered, blockchain-enabled, cloud-native..."

**Fix**: Only include trends if genuinely relevant to your value.
