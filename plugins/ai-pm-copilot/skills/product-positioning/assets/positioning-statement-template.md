# Positioning Statement Templates

## Three Proven Formats

Choose the format that best fits your context and audience.

---

## Format 1: Classic Positioning Statement

### Template

```
For [target customer]
Who [customer need/problem]
The [product name] is a [market category]
That [key benefit/value]
Unlike [competitive alternative]
Our product [key differentiation]
```

### Example: Uber

```
For urban professionals
Who need reliable transportation on-demand
Uber is a ride-hailing service
That gets you a ride in minutes via app
Unlike calling a taxi or driving yourself
Uber is faster, cashless, and rates drivers for quality
```

### When to Use

- Launching new product
- Presentations
- Sales enablement
- External communications

### Filling Out the Template

**Target Customer**: Be specific, not broad

- Bad: "Anyone who needs [X]"
- Good: "Enterprise sales teams with 10+ reps"

**Customer Need/Problem**: The pain point

- Focus on problem, not solution
- Should resonate deeply with target

**Market Category**: The mental box

- Existing category customers understand
- Or new category you're creating
- Test: Does category help or hurt understanding?

**Key Benefit/Value**: The outcome

- What customer achieves
- Quantify if possible (2x faster, 50% cost reduction)

**Competitive Alternative**: What they use today

- Not just competitors, but alternatives
- Could be manual process, spreadsheet, email

**Key Differentiation**: Why you're unique

- What you do that alternatives can't
- Must be meaningful and defensible

## Format 2: Geoffrey Moore's Positioning Format

### Template

```
For [target customers]
Who are dissatisfied with [current alternative]
Our product is a [new category]
That provides [key problem-solving capability]
Unlike [product alternative]
We have assembled [key whole product features]
```

### Example: Slack

```
For teams
Who are frustrated with email for internal communication
Slack is a team messaging platform
That makes communication fast, organized, and searchable
Unlike email threads that get lost and chaotic
We've built channels, integrations, and persistent chat
```

### When to Use

- Category creation (positioning as new type of product)
- Crossing the Chasm (moving to mainstream market)
- Complex B2B products
- Need to emphasize complete solution

### Key Differences from Classic Format

- Emphasizes **dissatisfaction** with current alternative
- Highlights **new category** (not just better in existing)
- Details **whole product** (complete solution, not just core)

### Filling Out the Template

**Dissatisfied with**: The pain with status quo

- Strong emotional language ("frustrated", "overwhelmed")
- Validates customer feeling

**New Category**: Create or redefine category

- Signals different approach
- Example: "Team messaging" not "business communication"

**Key Problem-Solving Capability**: The transformation

- How product fundamentally solves problem
- Focus on capability, not features

**Whole Product Features**: Complete solution

- Everything needed to succeed
- Shows you've thought through full experience

## Format 3: Value Proposition Statement (One-Liner)

### Template

```
[Product] helps [target customer] [achieve goal/solve problem]
by [unique mechanism/approach]
```

### Example: Superhuman

```
Superhuman helps executives and VCs get through email twice as fast
by rebuilding email from scratch with speed-optimized keyboard shortcuts
```

### When to Use

- Homepage headline
- Elevator pitch
- Quick intro (conferences, networking)
- Social media bio
- Simplest explanation

### Why This Format Works

- **Concise**: One sentence
- **Benefit-focused**: Starts with outcome
- **Differentiated**: Unique mechanism makes it clear how
- **Memorable**: Easy to repeat

### Filling Out the Template

**Product**: Your product name

**Target Customer**: Specific segment

- Not "users" or "people"
- "Executives managing 100+ emails/day"

**Achieve Goal/Solve Problem**: The outcome

- Specific, measurable if possible
- "Get through email twice as fast" (not "manage email better")

**Unique Mechanism/Approach**: How you do it differently

- What's unique about your approach?
- "Rebuilding from scratch with keyboard shortcuts" (not "better email client")

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Too Vague

"For businesses who want to be more productive..."

### ✓ Specific

"For SaaS sales teams with 10+ reps who struggle to track deals..."

---

### ❌ Feature-Focused

"Our product has AI, automation, and analytics..."

### ✓ Benefit-Focused

"Helps you close 30% more deals by automating follow-ups..."

---

### ❌ Weak Differentiation

"Unlike competitors, we have a mobile app"

### ✓ Strong Differentiation

"Unlike spreadsheet-based tracking, we automatically capture deal data from email..."

---

### ❌ Jargon and Buzzwords

"AI-powered, cloud-native, blockchain-enabled platform..."

### ✓ Plain Language

"Automatically suggests next best actions based on your deal history..."

## Validation Checklist

Use this to test your positioning statement:

- [ ] **Specific target**: Could I find 100 people who match this description?
- [ ] **Real problem**: Do target customers actually have this pain?
- [ ] **Clear category**: Do customers understand what type of product this is?
- [ ] **Quantified value**: Is the benefit specific and measurable?
- [ ] **Real alternative**: Is this actually what customers would use instead?
- [ ] **Unique differentiation**: Do we actually have this capability that alternatives lack?
- [ ] **30-second test**: Can anyone on team explain this clearly in 30 seconds?
- [ ] **No jargon**: Could my non-technical friend understand this?

## Next Steps

1. Choose format that fits your context
2. Fill out template (be specific, avoid vague language)
3. Validate with 5-10 target customers (do they understand? does it resonate?)
4. Test with sales team (can they pitch it?)
5. Iterate based on feedback
6. Document final positioning
7. Use consistently across all communications

---

**Key Principle**: Great positioning statements are simple, specific, and customer-centric. Focus on the problem you solve and why you're uniquely suited to solve it.
