# Competitive Positioning Map Template

## Overview

A competitive positioning map (also called a perceptual map) visualizes how your product and competitors are positioned along two key dimensions that matter to customers. It helps identify market gaps and differentiation opportunities.

## Why Use Positioning Maps

**Visualize competitive landscape**: See where you and competitors sit at a glance

**Identify white space**: Find uncrowded positioning opportunities

**Communicate strategy**: Simple visual for the team to understand positioning

**Validate differentiation**: Ensure you're positioned differently from alternatives

## Creating Your Positioning Map

### Step 1: Choose Two Dimensions

Pick dimensions that:

1. **Matter to customers** - Not internal metrics, but customer-facing value
2. **Differentiate competitors** - Competitors spread across the axes
3. **Favor your strengths** - Ideally, you own a desirable position

**Good Dimension Examples**:

- Simple vs Complex
- Low Cost vs Premium
- Generalist vs Specialist
- Easy to Use vs Powerful
- Speed vs Features
- DIY vs Done-for-You
- Individual vs Enterprise

**Bad Dimension Examples** (avoid):

- Technology stack (customers don't care)
- Founded date (not value-based)
- Number of employees (irrelevant)
- Funding raised (not customer value)

### Step 2: Plot Competitors

Place each competitor on the map based on how customers perceive them (not how they describe themselves).

**Use customer perspective**, not competitor marketing claims.

### Step 3: Identify White Space

Look for:

- **Uncrowded quadrants** - Less competition
- **Underserved segments** - High customer demand, few solutions
- **Your strengths** - Where you can credibly position

### Step 4: Position Yourself

Choose positioning that:

- Plays to your strengths
- Differentiates from alternatives
- Serves meaningful customer segment
- Is credible (customers believe it)

## Example 1: CRM Market

### Dimensions

- **Horizontal**: Simple → Complex
- **Vertical**: SMB → Enterprise

### Map

```
                Enterprise
                    │
    Salesforce      │      Microsoft Dynamics
                    │
                    │
Simple ─────────────┼───────────── Complex
                    │
                    │
      HubSpot       │      Pipedrive
                    │
                  SMB
```

### Analysis

- **Salesforce**: Enterprise, complex (powerful but hard to use)
- **Microsoft Dynamics**: Enterprise, complex (similar to Salesforce)
- **HubSpot**: SMB, simple (easy for small teams)
- **Pipedrive**: SMB, simple (similar to HubSpot)

**White Space**: Enterprise + Simple (powerful but easy to use)

**Opportunity**: A CRM that brings enterprise capabilities with SMB simplicity would differentiate.

## Example 2: Project Management Tools

### Dimensions

- **Horizontal**: Flexible → Opinionated
- **Vertical**: Individual → Teams

### Map

```
                  Teams
                    │
       Asana        │       Jira
                    │
                    │
Flexible ───────────┼────────────── Opinionated
                    │
                    │
      Notion        │      Todoist
                    │
              Individual
```

### Analysis

- **Asana**: Team collaboration, flexible workflows
- **Jira**: Team projects, opinionated (agile methodologies)
- **Notion**: Individual or small teams, highly flexible
- **Todoist**: Individual tasks, opinionated (GTD methodology)

**White Space**: Individual + Opinionated (structured personal productivity)

**Positioning Decision**: Notion positioned in flexible/individual, differentiating from more opinionated or team-focused tools.

## Example 3: Email Clients

### Dimensions

- **Horizontal**: Traditional → Reimagined
- **Vertical**: Free → Premium

### Map

```
                 Premium
                    │
                    │   Superhuman
                    │
                    │
Traditional ────────┼────────────── Reimagined
                    │
    Gmail           │      Hey
    Outlook         │
                    │
                  Free
```

### Analysis

- **Gmail/Outlook**: Free, traditional email experience
- **Superhuman**: Premium ($30/mo), reimagined for speed
- **Hey**: Premium ($99/year), reimagined workflows

**White Space**: Superhuman positioned in Premium + Reimagined quadrant (uncrowded at launch)

**Differentiation**: Most email clients were free/traditional. Superhuman and Hey both chose premium/reimagined, but differentiated on speed vs. workflow.

## Choosing Dimensions: Decision Framework

### Dimension Selection Criteria

**1. Customer-Relevant**
Ask: Do customers evaluate alternatives on this dimension?

- ✓ "Simple vs. Powerful" (customers care)
- ✗ "Ruby vs. Python" (technical detail customers don't care about)

**2. Differentiating**
Ask: Are competitors spread across this dimension, or clustered?

- ✓ Competitors spread across dimension (creates meaningful positioning)
- ✗ All competitors in one spot (dimension doesn't differentiate)

**3. Favorable to You**
Ask: Can we credibly claim a position on this dimension?

- ✓ Position aligns with our strengths
- ✗ Position requires capabilities we lack

### Common Dimension Pairs

**By Price and Value**:

- Low Cost ↔ Premium Price
- Basic Features ↔ Comprehensive Features

**By Complexity**:

- Simple ↔ Powerful
- Easy to Use ↔ Advanced Capabilities
- Opinionated ↔ Flexible

**By Audience**:

- Individual ↔ Enterprise
- SMB ↔ Large Company
- Consumer ↔ Professional

**By Approach**:

- DIY ↔ Done-for-You
- Generalist ↔ Specialist
- Traditional ↔ Innovative

**By Speed and Quality**:

- Fast Setup ↔ Comprehensive
- Quick Wins ↔ Long-term Solution

## Using the Map Strategically

### Scenario 1: Crowded Quadrant

**Situation**: Many competitors in your current quadrant

**Options**:

1. **Move to different quadrant** (reposition)
2. **Create third dimension** (split the quadrant with new axis)
3. **Zoom in** (find sub-segment differentiation within quadrant)

**Example**: HubSpot was crowded in "SMB Marketing Automation" space, so they created "Inbound Marketing" category (new dimension) to differentiate.

### Scenario 2: Empty Quadrant

**Situation**: White space quadrant with no competitors

**Questions to Ask**:

- **Is it truly unserved?** Or is there no demand?
- **Can we credibly serve it?** Or do we lack capabilities?
- **Will customers value it?** Or is positioning unappealing?

**Example**: "Enterprise + Simple" CRM might be white space because it's hard to deliver both (enterprise features require complexity).

### Scenario 3: You're in the Wrong Quadrant

**Situation**: Current positioning doesn't match target market needs

**Action**: Reposition

- Identify target quadrant
- Develop capabilities to credibly claim that position
- Launch repositioning campaign

**Example**: Slack repositioned from "SMB team chat" to "Enterprise collaboration platform" as they moved upmarket.

## Advanced: Multi-Dimensional Positioning

### 3D Positioning Map

For complex markets, add a third dimension:

```
            Z-axis (e.g., Vertical: Horizontal → Vertical)
                ↗
               │
              │
             │  ● Competitor A
            │     ● Competitor B
           │
          │
         │_____________ X-axis (e.g., Simple → Complex)
        │
       │
      │
     ↓
  Y-axis (e.g., SMB → Enterprise)
```

**When to Use**: When two dimensions aren't sufficient to show meaningful differentiation

**Risk**: Harder to communicate, more complex

### Multiple Maps for Multiple Segments

Create different maps for different customer segments:

**Example (Slack)**:

- **SMB Map**: Simple ↔ Complex, Free ↔ Paid
- **Enterprise Map**: Security ↔ Features, Single-Region ↔ Global

**Why**: Different segments care about different dimensions

**Your Position**:

- [ ] Position is differentiated (not crowded)
- [ ] Position is credible (customers believe it)
- [ ] Position plays to strengths
- [ ] Position serves meaningful segment

**Validation**:

- [ ] Shown to customers (do they agree with competitor placement?)

## Common Mistakes

### Choosing Internal Dimensions

"Number of integrations" (internal metric) vs. "Productivity gain" (customer value)

**Fix**: Choose dimensions customers use to evaluate alternatives

### Placing Competitors Incorrectly

Positioning competitors based on their marketing claims, not customer perception

**Fix**: Validate with customer interviews - where do they see competitors?

### Positioning in Incredible Space

Claiming "Enterprise + Cheapest" when you lack enterprise capabilities or low-cost structure

**Fix**: Choose position you can credibly deliver

### Too Many Dimensions

Creating 4D or 5D maps that are impossible to visualize

**Fix**: Stick to 2 dimensions, create multiple maps if needed

### Static Map

Creating map once and never updating as market evolves

**Fix**: Refresh quarterly, especially when new competitors enter or you reposition

---

## Next Steps

1. Identify 4-6 key dimensions customers care about
2. Choose the 2 dimensions that best differentiate competitors
3. Plot all major competitive alternatives on the map
4. Identify white space and positioning opportunities
5. Choose your position based on strengths and differentiation
6. Validate map with customers and sales team
7. Use map in positioning docs and presentations
8. Update quarterly as market evolves

---

## Related Activities

**Before Creating Map**:

- Customer interviews to understand evaluation criteria
- Competitive analysis to understand alternatives
- Internal assessment of strengths

**After Creating Map**:

- Positioning statement that reflects chosen position
- Messaging that emphasizes differentiating dimensions
- Product roadmap to strengthen position

---

**Key Principle**: Positioning maps are visual strategy tools. Choose dimensions that matter to customers, place yourself in differentiated position that plays to your strengths, and use the map to communicate positioning clearly.
