# Messaging Hierarchy Template

## Overview

Messaging hierarchy creates alignment between internal positioning strategy and external market communications. It flows from strategic positioning → external messaging → tactical copy.

## Three-Level Hierarchy

```
Level 1: POSITIONING (Internal Strategy)
           ↓
Level 2: MESSAGING (External Communication)
           ↓
Level 3: COPY (Tactical Execution)
```

## Level 1: Positioning (Internal)

### Purpose

Internal alignment on strategic positioning

### Audience

**Internal only**: Product, marketing, sales, exec, engineering - entire company

### Content

**1. Target Market**

- Who are we targeting?
- What characteristics do they share?
- Why are they our best customers?

**2. Competitive Alternatives**

- What would customers use if we didn't exist?
- What status quo are we disrupting?

**3. Unique Attributes**

- What capabilities do we have that alternatives don't?
- What makes us meaningfully different?

**4. Value Themes**

- Why do customers care about our unique attributes?
- What outcomes do we enable?

**5. Market Category**

- What mental box do customers put us in?
- How does category set expectations?

### Example (Slack)

```markdown
## Positioning Document (Internal)

**Target Market**: Teams (5-500 people) frustrated with email for internal communication

**Competitive Alternative**: Email for team coordination

**Unique Attributes**:

- Real-time group messaging
- Persistent, searchable channels organized by topic
- Deep integrations with other tools

**Value Themes**:

1. Speed: Make decisions 10x faster than email
2. Transparency: Everyone sees conversations, nothing lost
3. Productivity: Bring tools into one place

**Market Category**: Team messaging platform
```

### Format

- Living document (updated quarterly)
- Shared with entire company
- Reference for all teams making positioning decisions
- Foundation for all external messaging

---

## Level 2: Messaging (External)

### Purpose

Translate internal positioning into external market communication

### Audience

**External**: Prospects, customers, partners, media - anyone outside company

### Content

**1. Value Proposition (One-Liner)**

- Short statement of what you do and why it matters
- For homepage, elevator pitch, quick intro

**2. Key Messages (3-5)**

- Core messages that support value proposition
- Should ladder up to value themes from positioning

**3. Proof Points**

- Evidence that validates each key message
- Customer quotes, metrics, case studies

**4. Differentiation Statement**

- How you're different from alternatives
- Why customers should choose you

### Example (Slack)

```markdown
## External Messaging

**Value Proposition**:
Slack makes team communication fast, organized, and searchable—replacing email for internal collaboration.

**Key Messages**:

1. **Faster decisions**
   - Real-time messaging means no waiting for email replies
   - Make decisions 10x faster than email threads
   - Proof: "We cut our meeting time by 50% using Slack" - Customer

2. **Nothing gets lost**
   - All conversations are searchable and preserved
   - New team members can search history to get up to speed
   - Proof: "Onboarding time reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days" - Customer

3. **Everything in one place**
   - 2,000+ integrations bring your tools into Slack
   - Reduce context switching between apps
   - Proof: "Reduced tool sprawl from 12 apps to 5" - Customer

**Differentiation**:
Unlike email which is chaotic and hard to search, Slack organizes conversations into channels, keeps everything searchable, and integrates with the tools you already use.
```

### Format

- **Messaging guide** document
- Shared with marketing, sales, customer success
- Used across all external communications
- Updated when positioning changes

### Channels Using Level 2 Messaging

- Website homepage

---

## Level 3: Copy (Tactical)

### Purpose

Specific copy for campaigns, pages, ads, and content

### Audience

**Channel-specific**: Different copy for different channels and campaigns

### Content

**1. Headlines**

- Attention-grabbing first line
- Specific to channel and campaign

**2. Body Copy**

- Detailed explanation
- Adapted for channel (long-form blog vs short ad)

**3. CTAs (Calls to Action)**

- What action do you want audience to take?
- Specific to conversion goal

**4. Feature Descriptions**

- Detailed feature explanations
- Connected to value themes

### Example (Slack)

**Homepage Hero**:

```
Headline: Where work happens
Subheadline: Slack brings your team together, wherever you are
CTA: Get started for free
```

**LinkedIn Ad**:

```
Headline: Tired of email overload?
Body: Slack replaces email for team communication. Get organized with channels, find anything with search, and integrate your favorite tools.
CTA: Try Slack free
```

**Feature Page (Channels)**:

```
Headline: Organized conversations
Body: Channels keep conversations organized by topic, project, or team. Instead of email threads that go off track, channels keep discussions focused and searchable.
Benefit: Find important decisions fast without digging through email
CTA: See how channels work
```

**Sales Email**:

```
Subject: Cut meeting time in half with Slack
Body: Hi [Name], noticed your team uses email for coordination. We help teams like [similar company] reduce meetings by 50% by replacing email with real-time channels. Worth a 15-min demo?
CTA: [Book demo]
```

### Format

- **Multiple documents** by channel
- Owned by channel teams (marketing, content, sales)
- Updated frequently for campaigns
- A/B tested and optimized

### Channels Using Level 3 Copy

- Email campaigns
- Social media posts
- Blog posts

## How the Hierarchy Works

### Consistency Through Levels

**Level 1 → Level 2**:

- Value Themes → Key Messages
- Unique Attributes → Differentiation
- Target Market → Audience Segmentation

**Level 2 → Level 3**:

- Value Proposition → Headlines
- Key Messages → Body Copy
- Proof Points → Testimonials in copy

### Example Flow (Slack)

**Level 1 (Positioning)**:
Value Theme: Speed - Make decisions 10x faster than email

**Level 2 (Messaging)**:
Key Message: "Real-time messaging means no waiting for email replies. Make decisions 10x faster."

**Level 3 (Copy)**:

- Homepage: "Where work happens - in real time"
- Ad: "Stop waiting for email replies. Make decisions faster with Slack."
- Feature page: "Instant messaging for instant decisions. No more waiting hours for email responses."

### Do: Update Together

- Change positioning → Update messaging → Refresh copy

## Common Mistakes

### Inconsistent Messaging Across Channels

**Problem**: Homepage says one thing, sales deck says another, ads say a third
**Fix**: Create level 2 messaging guide that all channels reference

### Copy That Doesn't Ladder Up

**Problem**: Clever headline that doesn't connect to positioning
**Fix**: Trace every piece of copy back to key messages

### Too Many Messages

**Problem**: 10 different value propositions, 15 key messages
**Fix**: Limit to ONE value prop, 3-5 key messages

### Feature-Focused Copy

**Problem**: "We have channels, threads, search..." without connecting to value
**Fix**: Features → Benefits → Value at every level

### Updating Copy Without Updating Positioning

**Problem**: Copy evolves over time, drifts from positioning
**Fix**: Regular messaging audits to ensure alignment

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete Level 1: Internal positioning document
2. Translate to Level 2: External messaging guide (value prop, key messages, proof)
3. Create Level 3: Channel-specific copy (homepage, ads, emails)
4. Train teams: Ensure everyone understands hierarchy
5. Audit regularly: Check all copy ladders up to positioning
6. Update together: When positioning changes, cascade through levels

---

**Key Principle**: Messaging hierarchy ensures consistency from strategy to execution. Every piece of external copy should trace back to your positioning through your key messages.
