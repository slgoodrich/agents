# Product Positioning

## Overview

Product positioning is the strategic process of defining how your product is uniquely different and valuable compared to alternatives, and how it fits into the market landscape in the minds of your target customers.

**Core Principle**: Positioning is context that helps customers understand what your product is, why it's special, and why they should care.

**Origin**: Modern positioning frameworks built on Al Ries & Jack Trout's "Positioning" (1981) and evolved by April Dunford in "Obviously Awesome" (2019) for modern products.

**Key Insight**: Great positioning makes everything else easier - sales, marketing, product development. Bad positioning makes everything harder, even if you have a great product.

## When to Use This Skill

## Positioning Framework Overview

### The 6 Components (in order)

Every positioning must define these components IN SEQUENCE:

**1. Competitive Alternatives**

- What would customers do if your product didn't exist?
- NOT competitors—alternatives (email, spreadsheets, manual process)
- Frame: "Compared to..."

**2. Unique Attributes**

- Capabilities you have that alternatives don't
- Meaningfully different, not just features

**3. Value (and Proof)**

- Why customers care about your unique attributes
- Group attributes into 2-4 value themes
- Provide proof (customer quotes, metrics, case studies)

**4. Target Market Characteristics**

- Who cares most about your value?
- Specific segment with shared characteristics
- NOT "everyone"

**5. Market Category**

- The mental box customers put you in
- Sets expectations about features, price, competitors
- Choose category that makes your value obvious

**6. Relevant Trends (Optional)**

- Market forces that make your product timely
- Use sparingly—only if genuinely relevant
- NOT buzzword stuffing

## Positioning Statement Frameworks

Once you've defined the 6 components, capture them in a positioning statement.

### Three Proven Formats

**1. Classic Positioning Statement**

```
For [target customer]
Who [customer need/problem]
The [product name] is a [market category]
That [key benefit/value]
Unlike [competitive alternative]
Our product [key differentiation]
```

**2. Geoffrey Moore's Format**

```
For [target customers]
Who are dissatisfied with [current alternative]
Our product is a [new category]
That provides [key problem-solving capability]
Unlike [product alternative]
We have assembled [key whole product features]
```

**3. Value Proposition One-Liner**

```
[Product] helps [target customer] [achieve goal/solve problem]
by [unique mechanism/approach]
```

## Differentiation Strategies

### Five Core Strategies

**1. Feature Differentiation**

- Unique capabilities competitors don't have
- Example: Zoom's gallery view, Notion's all-in-one workspace
- When: Technical innovation, hard-to-copy features

**2. Quality Differentiation**

- Superior performance on existing dimensions
- Example: Superhuman's 100ms speed, Netflix's 99.9% uptime
- When: Can sustainably deliver better quality

**3. Experience Differentiation**

- Better end-to-end customer experience
- Example: Apple's ecosystem, Zappos' service
- When: Experience is hard to replicate, consistent across touchpoints

**4. Price Differentiation**

- Significantly lower or higher price point
- Example: Southwest (low), Rolex (high)
- When: Cost structure or value perception supports it

**5. Category Creation**

- Create new category you can own
- Example: Salesforce ("no software"), HubSpot ("inbound marketing")
- When: Truly novel approach, willing to educate market

## Messaging Hierarchy

Transform positioning into consistent external communications.

### Three Levels

**Level 1: Positioning (Internal)**

- Target market, alternatives, attributes, value, category
- Shared with entire company
- Foundation for all external messaging

**Level 2: Messaging (External)**

- Value proposition (one-liner)
- Key messages (3-5 that support positioning)
- Proof points (evidence for each message)
- Differentiation statement

**Level 3: Copy (Tactical)**

- Headlines and body copy
- CTAs for specific channels
- Feature descriptions
- Channel-specific adaptation (website, ads, emails, sales)

**Principle**: Every piece of copy ladders up to messaging, messaging ladders up to positioning.

## Competitive Positioning Maps

Visualize competitive landscape to identify white space and differentiation opportunities.

### Creating the Map

**1. Choose Two Dimensions**

- Must matter to customers (not internal metrics)
- Must differentiate competitors (spread across axes)
- Should favor your strengths

**2. Plot Competitors**

- Place based on customer perception (not competitor claims)
- Include all major alternatives

**3. Identify White Space**

- Uncrowded quadrants
- Underserved customer segments

**4. Position Yourself**

- Differentiated from alternatives
- Plays to your strengths
- Credible to customers

**Example Dimensions**: Simple ↔ Complex, SMB ↔ Enterprise, Flexible ↔ Opinionated, Free ↔ Premium

## Positioning Tests and Validation

### Four Essential Tests

**1. The Elevator Test**

- Can anyone in company explain positioning in 30 seconds?
- Pass: Consistent explanations across team

**2. The Sales Test**

- Does sales team use positioning in every pitch?
- Pass: Sales converging on consistent message, customers understand quickly

**3. The Win/Loss Test**

- Are you winning based on your differentiation?
- Pass: Wins cite your differentiation, losses are about fit (not confusion)

**4. The Pricing Test**

- Does positioning support your pricing?
- Pass: Premium positioning = Premium pricing acceptance

### When to Reposition

**Triggers**:

1. Win rate declining (losing to new competitors)
2. Attracting wrong customers (not target market)
3. Market shift (category expectations changed)
4. Product evolution (added major capabilities)
5. Market expansion (entering new segment)

## Common Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Everything for Everyone

"CRM for sales, marketing, service, ops, and more!"
**Fix**: Pick specific segment and value

### ❌ The Feature List

"We have channels, threads, search, integrations..."
**Fix**: Features → Benefits → Value

### ❌ The Buzzword Soup

"AI-powered, blockchain-enabled, cloud-native platform"
**Fix**: Plain language, actual differentiation

### ❌ The Category Confusion

"We're a CRM... and project management... and communication..."
**Fix**: Pick one primary category

### ❌ The Weak Differentiation

"Unlike competitors, we have a mobile app"
**Fix**: Find real, meaningful differentiation

**Detailed anti-patterns**: `references/positioning-validation-guide.md` (Part 3)

## Best Practices

**1. Start with Customers**

- Interview 10-15 customers who love your product
- Understand why they chose you and what value they get
- Look for patterns in best customers

**2. Follow the Sequence**

- Define components in order (alternatives → attributes → value → market → category)
- Each builds on previous
- Don't skip steps

**3. Be Specific**

- Target market: "Enterprise sales teams with 10+ reps" not "businesses"
- Value: "2x faster" not "more efficient"
- Differentiation: Concrete capabilities, not vague claims

**4. Test and Validate**

- Elevator test (30-second explanation)
- Sales test (consistent pitch)
- Win/loss analysis (winning on differentiation)
- Customer interviews (positioning resonates)

**5. Align and Document**

- Share positioning with entire company
- Train all teams (sales, marketing, CS, product)
- Update quarterly or when major changes occur
- Reference in all strategic decisions

**6. Iterate Based on Results**

- Track win rate, customer fit, sales velocity
- Reposition when triggers occur
- Refresh as market or product evolves
