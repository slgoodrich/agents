## Positioning Statement Guide

**April Dunford's framework**:

1. **Competitive alternatives**: What would customers use if you didn't exist?
2. **Unique attributes**: What do you have that alternatives don't?
3. **Value (benefits)**: What value do those attributes enable?
4. **Target customer**: Who cares most about that value?
5. **Market category**: What context makes your value obvious?

Work backwards: Start with attributes, derive value, identify who cares, then position.
