## What is Positioning?

**Geoffrey Moore's definition**:
> Positioning is the single largest influence on the buying decision. It's the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot about.

**Key concept**: Positioning is about **context**. You position your product in a market category that makes your value obvious to your target customer.

**Not**: What you say about your product (that's messaging)
**But**: How you frame the competitive context

## April Dunford's Positioning Framework

### The 5 Components

Work through these in order (not intuitive order):

**1. Competitive Alternatives**
- What would customers use if you didn't exist?
- Not "competitors" (similar products)
- But "alternatives" (how they solve problem today)

Examples:
- Spreadsheets
- Manual process
- Ignoring the problem
- Incumbent competitor

**2. Unique Attributes**
- What can you do that alternatives can't?
- Features, capabilities, or approaches
- Must be demonstrably unique (provable)

**3. Value (Benefits)**
- What do those unique attributes enable?
- Customer outcomes, not features
- "You can..." not "We have..."

**4. Target Customer**
- Who cares most about that value?
- Specific segment, not "everyone"
- Validated by customer research

**5. Market Category**
- What context makes your value obvious?
- Existing category or create new one
- Where prospects understand your value immediately

### Example Walkthrough

**Product**: Sales automation tool

**1. Competitive Alternatives**: Salesforce + manual prospecting
**2. Unique Attributes**: AI-powered lead scoring, automated outreach
**3. Value**: 10x more meetings booked with same team size
**4. Target Customer**: Series A B2B SaaS companies with 2-5 sales reps
**5. Market Category**: AI-powered sales development platform

**Positioning Statement**:
> For Series A B2B SaaS companies who need to scale pipeline without growing SDR headcount, [Product] is an AI-powered sales development platform that books 10x more qualified meetings using automated lead scoring and outreach. Unlike Salesforce which requires large SDR teams to execute, we use AI to automate the entire top-of-funnel.

## Perceptual Mapping

### Purpose

Visual tool to:
- Show competitive landscape at a glance
- Identify white space (underserved segments)
- Reveal crowded markets (avoid competing there)
- Communicate strategic positioning

### Creating Perceptual Maps

**Step 1: Choose Axes**

Pick dimensions that:
- Matter to customers (validated through research)
- You can differentiate on (not table stakes)
- Create meaningful segments

**Common axes**:
- Price vs. Capabilities
- Ease of Use vs. Power/Flexibility
- Horizontal (broad) vs. Vertical (niche)
- Self-serve vs. Enterprise
- All-in-one vs. Best-of-breed

**Step 2: Plot Competitors**

- Research each competitor's position
- Use customer perception (not just features)
- Validate with data (pricing, reviews, positioning)

**Step 3: Identify Patterns**

Look for:
- **White space**: Underserved segments (opportunity)
- **Crowded quadrants**: Avoid competing here
- **Movement**: Strategic direction over time
- **Gaps**: What's missing in market

### Strategic Implications

**White space found**:
- Is it underserved or not viable? (validate)
- Can you win there? (assess capabilities)
- Big enough? (market size)

**Crowded space**:
- Avoid head-to-head competition
- Find different differentiation axes
- Or leapfrog with 10x better solution

## Differentiation Strategies

### Types of Differentiation

**1. Product Differentiation**
- Features/capabilities competitors lack
- Superior user experience
- Better performance
- Stronger reliability

**When it works**: Defensible advantage, hard to copy

**2. Operational Differentiation**
- Better service/support
- Faster implementation
- More responsive
- Higher availability

**When it works**: Operationally excellent org, scale advantage

**3. Positioning Differentiation**
- Serve different segment
- Different use case
- Different category
- Different job-to-be-done

**When it works**: Product parity, clear market segment

**4. Business Model Differentiation**
- Different pricing (freemium, usage-based)
- Different sales motion (self-serve vs. sales-led)
- Different partnerships/ecosystem

**When it works**: Market receptive to new model

### Defensible vs. Temporary

**Defensible differentiation**:
- Network effects
- Data advantage
- Brand/trust (earned over time)
- Ecosystem/integrations
- Proprietary technology
- Operational excellence at scale

**Temporary differentiation**:
- Single features (easily copied)
- Pricing (can be matched)
- Marketing tactics
- Design (can be replicated)

**Strategy**: Build temporary advantages into defensible ones.

## Positioning for Different Stages

### Early Stage (Pre-PMF)

**Challenge**: No market position yet

**Approach**:
- Niche positioning (specific customer, use case)
- Position against alternatives (not competitors)
- Land and expand (win narrow segment first)

**Example**: "Stripe for SaaS billing" (narrow initially)

### Growth Stage (PMF Found)

**Challenge**: Scaling while maintaining differentiation

**Approach**:
- Expand positioning (broader segment)
- Competitive positioning (vs. alternatives)
- Category leadership (own the category)

**Example**: "The billing platform for SaaS companies"

### Scale Stage (Market Leader)

**Challenge**: Defending position, staying relevant

**Approach**:
- Category definition (shape market perception)
- Platform positioning (ecosystem play)
- Innovation positioning (staying ahead)

**Example**: "The complete payments and billing infrastructure"

---

## Positioning Validation

### Customer Research

**Questions to ask**:
- "How would you describe what we do?" (do they get it?)
- "What alternatives did you consider?" (what category are we in?)
- "Why did you choose us?" (actual differentiation)
- "What would you compare us to?" (competitive set)

**Red flags**:
- Customers can't articulate value
- Wide variety of "what we do" descriptions
- Positioned against wrong competitors
- Value prop doesn't resonate

### Market Testing

**Win/loss analysis**:
- Why we win: Validates differentiation
- Why we lose: Reveals positioning gaps
- Objection patterns: Shows positioning confusion

**Messaging testing**:
- A/B test positioning statements
- Track conversion rates
- Monitor bounce rates
- Test with sales (what resonates?)

---

## Repositioning

### When to Reposition

**Triggers**:
- Competitor closes key differentiator
- Market category shift
- Expansion into new segment
- Product evolution (new capabilities)
- Win/loss patterns change
- Customer feedback (positioning miss)

**Don't reposition** for:
- One lost deal
- Competitor noise
- Internal preference
- Minor feature gaps

### How to Reposition

**Process**:
1. **Validate need** (customer research, data)
2. **New positioning** (use framework above)
3. **Test messaging** (small sample first)
4. **Internal alignment** (sales, marketing, product)
5. **Systematic rollout** (all customer touchpoints)
6. **Train sales** (new talk tracks, battle cards)
7. **Monitor impact** (win rates, conversion, feedback)

**Timeline**: 3-6 months for full repositioning

## Common Positioning Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Positioning for Everyone
**Problem**: "We're for any company that needs [common thing]"
**Fix**: Narrow to specific segment, expand later

### Mistake 2: Feature-Led Positioning
**Problem**: "We have X, Y, Z features"
**Fix**: Lead with outcome/value, not features

### Mistake 3: Copying Competitor Positioning
**Problem**: "We're like [competitor] but cheaper/better"
**Fix**: Find different basis for comparison

### Mistake 4: Positioning Without Customer Input
**Problem**: Internal team decides positioning
**Fix**: Validate with customer research

### Mistake 5: Changing Too Often
**Problem**: Repositioning every quarter
**Fix**: Give positioning 6-12 months to work

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Market Category
**Problem**: Create new category without education
**Fix**: Use existing category or invest in education

## Positioning Deliverables

### Internal Alignment

**Positioning document** (for internal use):
- Competitive alternatives
- Unique attributes
- Value proposition
- Target customer
- Market category
- Proof points
- Messaging framework

### External Communication

**Website positioning**:
- Hero headline (value prop)
- Subhead (how/unique approach)
- Social proof (logos, testimonials)
- Category context (what you are)

**Sales positioning**:
- Elevator pitch (30 seconds)
- Discovery questions (uncover fit)
- Competitive battle cards
- Demo narrative (positioning-driven)

---

## For Solo Operators / Small Teams

**Simplified approach**:

**Time investment**: Half day initially, quarterly review

**Process**:
1. Interview 5-10 customers (why they chose you)
2. List competitive alternatives (what they'd use instead)
3. Identify 2-3 unique attributes
4. Write value prop (outcome those enable)
5. Define target segment (who cares most)
6. Test messaging (homepage, pitch, emails)

**Tools**: Template in `positioning-map-template.md`

**Focus**: Nail one clear positioning, not multiple

---

**Key Principle**: Positioning is strategic - it determines which market you compete in and how you win. Choose a market where your strengths matter most.
