## Intelligence Gathering

### Primary Sources (Most Valuable)

**Competitor's own materials**:

- Website (features, pricing, positioning)
- Product demos (sign up for trial)
- Marketing materials (ebooks, webinars)
- Press releases and blog posts
- Help documentation
- API documentation

**Customer feedback**:

- Reviews (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, App Store)
- Social media mentions (Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn)
- Community forums (their community + general communities)
- Support tickets (what customers ask for)

**Win/loss analysis**:

- Sales team debriefs
- Customer interviews (why they chose/didn't choose)
- Deal analysis (patterns in wins/losses)

### Secondary Sources

**Market intelligence**:

- Industry analysts (Gartner, Forrester)
- News and press coverage
- Podcast interviews with their leadership
- Conference presentations

**Hiring signals**:

- Job postings (what roles = strategic priorities)
- LinkedIn employee count trends
- Key hires (former employers = strategic direction)

**Financial data**:

- Funding announcements (Crunchbase, TechCrunch)
- Revenue estimates (public data, analyst estimates)
- Financial statements (if public company)

## Research Techniques

### Product Analysis

**Sign up for trials**:

- Create account with generic email
- Explore full product (screenshot key features)
- Test user experience (onboarding, workflows)
- Note technical implementation
- Document limitations encountered

**Mystery shopping**:

- Request sales demo (competitor doesn't know it's you)
- Ask questions customer would ask
- Note sales process and pitch
- Collect pricing and packaging details

### Customer Research

**Interview questions**:

- "What alternatives did you evaluate?"
- "Why did you choose [competitor] / not choose [competitor]?"
- "What do they do well / poorly?"
- "If you could change one thing about [competitor], what would it be?"

**Review analysis**:

- Read 20-30 recent reviews
- Look for patterns (recurring praise/complaints)
- Note feature mentions
- Track rating trends over time

## Intelligence Analysis

### Pattern Recognition

**Look for**:

- Feature launch frequency (product velocity)
- Market expansion (new segments, geographies)
- Pricing changes (increasing/decreasing, packaging shifts)
- Partnership announcements (ecosystem strategy)
- Messaging shifts (repositioning)

**Red flags (threats)**:

- Major funding round (war chest for competition)
- Key executive hires (strategy shift)
- Feature launches that close gaps
- Customer wins in your core market
- Aggressive pricing changes

**Green flags (opportunities)**:

- Leadership departures
- Negative review trends
- Missed launches or delays
- Customer complaints about specific pain
- Pricing increases (room to undercut)

### SWOT Framework

**Strengths (what they do well)**:

- Focus on facts, not assumptions
- Use customer quotes as evidence
- Quantify when possible

**Weaknesses (exploitable gaps)**:

- Look for consistent customer complaints
- Identify missing features competitors mention
- Find use cases they don't serve well

**Opportunities (for them)**:

- Think like their PM: "If I were them, what would I do?"
- Anticipate strategic moves
- Identify expansion paths

**Threats (to us)**:

- Based on their opportunities
- Consider resource advantages
- Account for strategic intent

**Competitive opportunities**:

- Competitor misstep (capitalize quickly)

## For Solo Operators / Small Teams

**Simplified approach**:

**Monthly routine** (2-3 hours):

1. Check competitor websites for changes
2. Read 5-10 recent G2 reviews
3. Scan their blog/changelog
4. Update battle card if needed

**Quarterly deep-dive** (half day):

1. Full product trial
2. Read 20-30 reviews
3. Update positioning map
4. Refresh competitive analysis doc

**Tools**:

- Google Alerts (free)
- Spreadsheet for tracking
- Notion for documentation

**Focus**: 2-3 most important competitors, not entire market.

---

**Key Principle**: Competitive intelligence informs strategy, not dictates it. Understand competitors to find your unique position, not to copy them.
