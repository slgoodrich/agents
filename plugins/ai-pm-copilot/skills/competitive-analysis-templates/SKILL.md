## Evidence Standards

**Core principle:** All competitive intelligence must be based on verifiable public sources. Strategic analysis and recommendations are core value, but factual claims require source attribution.

**Research requirements:**

1. **Use verifiable public sources**
   - Competitor websites, product pages, and documentation
   - Pricing pages (with URLs and date accessed)
   - Review sites (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius) with specific review citations
   - News articles, press releases, and public announcements
   - Product demos, trials, and publicly available materials

2. **Source attribution**
   - Every claim about competitor features, pricing, or strategy must cite source
   - Format: "[Feature/Claim] (Source: [URL], accessed [Date])"
   - Review quotes must cite specific review with link
   - When multiple sources confirm: cite 2-3 representative sources

3. **When data is unavailable**
   - Explicitly note: "[Pricing not publicly available]", "[Requires product trial]"
   - Never fabricate competitor information to complete analysis
   - Recommend steps to gather missing data (demo request, trial signup)
   - Note limitation in battle card or analysis

4. **What you CANNOT do**
   - Fabricate competitor features, pricing, or capabilities
   - Invent user testimonials or review quotes
   - Make up market share numbers or competitive statistics
   - Create fictional customer case studies

5. **What you SHOULD do (core value)**
   - Provide strategic analysis of competitive landscape
   - Identify differentiation opportunities based on research
   - Recommend positioning strategy against competitors
   - Guide battle card creation and sales enablement
   - Teach competitive intelligence methodologies
   - Help interpret competitive data for strategic decisions

**When in doubt:** If public information is unavailable, note the limitation explicitly rather than inventing data. Your strategic expertise in competitive analysis and positioning is your primary value.

## Choosing the Right Template

**For strategic planning** → Use all three:

1. Deep-dive analysis (understand landscape)
2. Positioning map (define your position)
3. Battle cards (enable execution)

**For sales enablement** → Battle cards:

- Quick reference during calls
- Specific talk tracks and counters
- Updated frequently

**For product strategy** → Deep-dive + Positioning:

- Feature gap analysis
- Market white space
- Differentiation strategy

**For one competitor** → Start with deep-dive, then battle card

**For market overview** → Positioning map first (landscape), then selective deep-dives

## Competitive Intelligence Process

### 1. Gather Intelligence

**Primary sources**:

- Competitor website, demos, trials
- Customer reviews (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius)
- Win/loss interviews
- Customer feedback

**Secondary sources**:

- Press releases, news
- Job postings (strategic direction)
- Social media, podcasts
- Analyst reports

**Source citation requirements:**

- Document URL and access date for every source
- Cite specific G2/Capterra reviews with links for user quotes
- Note when information is unavailable: "[Pricing not public]"
- Never fabricate data to fill intelligence gaps
- Recommend additional research steps for missing data

**Detailed guide**: `references/competitive-intel-guide.md`

Research techniques, intelligence sources, ethical guidelines, source citation best practices

---

### 2. Analyze Patterns

**Look for**:

- Feature launch velocity (product strategy)
- Market expansion signals
- Pricing changes
- Partnership announcements
- Messaging shifts

**Framework**: Use SWOT analysis

- **Strengths**: What they do well (facts, evidence)
- **Weaknesses**: Exploitable gaps (customer complaints, missing features)
- **Opportunities** (for them): Anticipate their moves
- **Threats** (to us): How they could hurt us

---

### 3. Act on Insights

**Product decisions**:

- Close critical gaps (table stakes)
- Exploit weaknesses (differentiation)
- Defend strengths (maintain advantage)

**Positioning**:

- Find defensible differentiation
- Avoid head-to-head on their strengths
- Position in category where you win

**Sales enablement**:

- Create battle cards (competitive situations)
- Train on objection handling
- Share win stories

## Positioning Frameworks

### April Dunford's 5 Components

Work through in this order:

**1. Competitive Alternatives**: What would customers use if you didn't exist?

**2. Unique Attributes**: What can you do that alternatives can't?

**3. Value (Benefits)**: What do those unique attributes enable?

**4. Target Customer**: Who cares most about that value?

**5. Market Category**: What context makes your value obvious?

**Example**:

> For Series A B2B SaaS companies who need to scale pipeline without growing SDR headcount, [Product] is an AI-powered sales development platform that books 10x more qualified meetings. Unlike Salesforce which requires large SDR teams, we use AI to automate the entire top-of-funnel.

**Complete framework**: `references/positioning-guide.md`

Positioning strategies, differentiation, perceptual mapping, validation

### Perceptual Mapping

**Purpose**: Visualize competitive landscape, find white space

**Common axes**:

- Price vs. Capabilities
- Ease of Use vs. Power
- Horizontal vs. Vertical
- Self-serve vs. Enterprise

**Strategic insights**:

- White space (underserved segments)
- Crowded areas (avoid competing)
- Movement over time (strategic direction)

**Template**: `assets/positioning-map-template.md`

Multiple perceptual map formats, strategic analysis

## Battle Card Best Practices

**Format**:

- 1-2 pages maximum (quick reference)
- Bullets, not paragraphs
- Specific talk tracks (exact words)
- Print-friendly

**Content**:

- Be honest about weaknesses (builds credibility)
- Use customer language (outcomes, not features)
- Include proof points (quotes, data, case studies)
- Provide discovery questions (uncover advantages)

**Maintenance**:

- Update immediately on competitor changes
- Monthly review, quarterly refresh
- Sales feedback loop
- Track win rates

**Detailed guide**: `references/battle-card-guide.md`

Creating, training, maintenance, metrics

    - Battle card.md
    - Product screenshots/
    - Reviews analysis.md
  /Competitor B
    [Same structure]
  /Market Maps
    - Positioning map.md

```

### Update Cadence

**Continuous**: Monitor for major changes (Google Alerts, RSS)

**Monthly**:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Feature parity obsession**:

- Problem: Building everything competitors have
- Fix: Focus on defensible differentiation

**Outdated intelligence**:

- Problem: Stale battle cards, wrong pricing
- Fix: Regular update cadence, monitoring systems

**Too comprehensive**:

- Problem: 50-page analysis nobody reads
- Fix: Right level of detail for audience (battle card vs. deep-dive)

**Ignoring weaknesses**:

- Problem: Only highlighting strengths
- Fix: Honest assessment of trade-offs

**Not using the intelligence**:

- Problem: Analysis sits in drive, not actioned
- Fix: Clear distribution, sales training, product impact

---

## For Solo Operators / Small Teams

**Simplified approach**:

**Focus**: 2-3 most important competitors only

**Monthly routine** (2-3 hours):

- Check competitor websites for changes
- Read 5-10 recent G2 reviews
- Scan their blog/changelog
- Update battle card if needed

**Quarterly deep-dive** (half day):

- Full product trial
- Read 20-30 reviews
- Update positioning map
- Refresh analysis doc

**Templates to use**:

- Battle card (1 page version)
- Simplified positioning map
- Lightweight deep-dive (key sections only)

**Tools**:

- Google Alerts (free monitoring)
- Spreadsheet for tracking
- Notion/Google Docs for documentation
