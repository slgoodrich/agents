## Quadrant Definitions

### Quick Wins (High Value, Low Effort)
**Do these first** - Maximum ROI with minimal investment
- High impact on key metrics
- Easy to implement (days to 1-2 weeks)
- Build momentum, show progress
- Examples: Small UX improvements, copy changes, simple integrations

### Big Bets (High Value, High Effort)
**Strategic investments** - High impact but requires significant resources
- Transformational features
- Takes weeks to months
- Requires careful planning
- Examples: New product lines, platform migrations, major redesigns

### Fill-Ins (Low Value, Low Effort)
**Do if spare capacity** - Easy wins but limited impact
- Nice-to-haves
- Quick to build
- Polish and delight
- Examples: Minor feature requests, aesthetic improvements

### Time Sinks (Low Value, High Effort)
**Avoid** - Poor ROI, consuming resources without return
- Complex but limited impact
- Say "no" confidently
- Revisit only if context changes
- Examples: Edge case features, over-engineering, premature optimization

## Scoring Template

| Feature | Value (1-10) | Effort (1-10) | Quadrant | Priority |
|---------|--------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Feature A | 9 | 3 | Quick Win | P0 |
| Feature B | 8 | 8 | Big Bet | P1 |
| Feature C | 3 | 7 | Time Sink | Reject |
| Feature D | 4 | 2 | Fill-In | P2 |
| Feature E | | | | |

## Value Scoring Guide (1-10)

**Value = Impact on key metric(s)**

- **9-10**: Transformational - moves north star metric significantly
- **7-8**: High impact - meaningful improvement to key metrics
- **5-6**: Moderate impact - noticeable but not dramatic
- **3-4**: Low impact - minor improvement
- **1-2**: Minimal impact - negligible effect

Consider:
- User impact (reach × depth)
- Business impact (revenue, retention, acquisition)
- Strategic fit (goal alignment)

## Effort Scoring Guide (1-10)

**Effort = Total team time to ship**

- **1-2**: Trivial (hours to 1 day)
- **3-4**: Easy (2-5 days)
- **5-6**: Moderate (1-2 weeks)
- **7-8**: Complex (3-4 weeks)
- **9-10**: Major (1+ months)

Consider:
- Design, engineering, QA, launch time
- Dependencies and blockers
- Technical complexity
- Unknowns and risks

## Visualization

### Quick Wins
- Feature X: Value 9, Effort 3
- Feature Y: Value 8, Effort 2
- Feature Z: Value 7, Effort 4

### Big Bets
- Feature A: Value 10, Effort 9
- Feature B: Value 9, Effort 8

### Fill-Ins
- Feature M: Value 4, Effort 3
- Feature N: Value 3, Effort 2

### Time Sinks (Avoid)
- Feature Q: Value 2, Effort 8
- Feature R: Value 3, Effort 9

## Prioritization Strategy

**P0 (Do Now)**: Quick Wins
- Ship immediately
- Build momentum
- Prove value fast

**P1 (Plan)**: Big Bets
- Requires planning and resourcing
- Sequence strategically
- Balance with quick wins (70% quick wins, 30% big bets)

**P2 (Buffer)**: Fill-Ins
- Use spare capacity
- Team morale boosters
- Polish releases

**Reject**: Time Sinks
- Communicate "why not"
- Archive for future review
- Redirect to quick wins

## Tips

- **Visual tool** - Great for presentations
- **Simple and fast** - Use for quick assessments, not deep analysis
- **Combine with RICE** - Use matrix for visualization, RICE for ranking
- **Re-evaluate regularly** - Value and effort change over time
- **Beware subjectivity** - Value especially can be debated, align on criteria
- **Portfolio balance** - Don't do only quick wins, balance with strategic bets

## Next Steps

1. List all features in backlog
2. Score each on Value (1-10) and Effort (1-10)
3. Plot on matrix (or use table)
4. Identify quadrant for each
5. Prioritize Quick Wins → Big Bets → Fill-Ins
6. Communicate and reject Time Sinks
7. Review quarterly as context changes
