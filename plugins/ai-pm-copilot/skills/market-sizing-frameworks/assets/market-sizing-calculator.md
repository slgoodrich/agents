# Market Sizing Calculator

Step-by-step calculator with all formulas and methods for estimating market size.

## Quick Reference: Three Methods

Use all three methods for validation:

1. **Bottom-Up**: Count customers × average revenue (most realistic)
2. **Top-Down**: Total market × your slice (good validation)
