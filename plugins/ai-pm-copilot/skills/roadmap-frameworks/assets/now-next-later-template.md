## When to Use

**Best for**:
- Fast-moving environments
- High uncertainty
- Want flexibility
- Avoid date commitments

**Not good for**:
- Complex dependencies
- Need resource planning
- Require executive buy-in on timeline

---

## Confidence Levels

**Now** (80-100% confidence):
- Problem validated
- Solution defined
- In active development
- Will deliver soon

**Next** (50-80% confidence):
- Problem validated
- Solution hypothesis
- Will likely do next
- Might change based on learnings

**Later** (20-50% confidence):
- Interesting signal
- Early exploration
- Direction, not commitment
- Could change dramatically

## Example

```markdown
# Product Roadmap - Q2 2024

## Now

### SSO Integration (SAML/OAuth)
**Problem**: Enterprise customers can't buy without SSO ($2M pipeline blocked)
**Approach**: SAML 2.0 + OAuth 2.0 support, Google Workspace + Okta first
**Status**: In development (80% complete)
**Expected**: Next 2-3 weeks

### Export Performance Improvements
**Problem**: Large exports (>10K rows) time out, users frustrated
**Approach**: Background job processing + email when complete
**Status**: Testing
**Expected**: Next 3-4 weeks

---

## Next

### Theme: Mobile Experience
**Why**: 40% of users try mobile, 80% bounce (poor experience)
**Initiatives**:
- Mobile-optimized dashboard
- Offline sync for field workers
- Push notifications
**Success Metrics**: Mobile MAU 2K → 5K, mobile NPS 30 → 50

### Theme: Analytics & Insights
**Why**: Users struggle to make data-driven decisions (top feature request)
**Initiatives**:
- Advanced filtering
- Custom dashboards
- Automated insights
**Success Metrics**: 60% of users use weekly, NPS +10 points

---

## Later

### AI-Powered Features
**Exploration**: Smart recommendations, automated workflows, predictive analytics
**Why it matters**: Competitive differentiator, reduces manual work

### International Expansion
**Exploration**: Multi-currency, multi-language, regional compliance
**Why it matters**: Unlock $5M TAM in EU/APAC

---

## Not Doing

- **Native desktop apps**: Low demand (5% of requests), web works well
- **Social login (Facebook, Twitter)**: Security/privacy concerns, SSO is priority
- **Custom branding**: Nice-to-have, doesn't move core metrics
```

---

## Tips

**Keep "Now" specific**:
- Active work items
- Clear deliverables
- Near-term completion

**Keep "Next" flexible**:
- Themes, not features
- Validated problems
- Room to adjust approach

**Keep "Later" vague**:
- Directions, not commitments
- Low confidence
- Explore, don't promise

**Always show trade-offs**:
- What you're NOT doing
- Why (strategy, data, resources)
- Manages expectations

---

## Updating the Roadmap

**Move items forward**:
- Later → Next (when validated)
- Next → Now (when resourced)
- Now → Shipped (when complete)

**Add new items**:
- Start in Later (low confidence)
- Graduate to Next (when validated)
- Promote to Now (when prioritized)

**Remove items**:
- Explicitly call out in "Not Doing"
- Explain why (don't just disappear)

**Frequency**: Update monthly, communicate changes

---

**Key Principle**: Now-Next-Later is about focus and flexibility. "Now" is your commitment, "Next" is your direction, "Later" is your vision. Everything else is "Not Doing".
