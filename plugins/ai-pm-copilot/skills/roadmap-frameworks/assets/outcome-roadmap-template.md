# Outcome-Based Roadmap Template

Lead with results, not outputs. Focus on customer/business outcomes.

---

## Template

```markdown
# Q[X] Outcomes Roadmap

## Outcome 1: [Customer/Business Result]
**Problem**: [Why this matters, impact of not solving]
**Success Metric**: [Baseline] → [Target] by [When]
**Approach**: [How we might solve - flexible]
**Confidence**: High | Medium | Low

## Outcome 2: [Customer/Business Result]
[Same format]

## Outcome 3: [Customer/Business Result]
[Same format]
```

## Example

```markdown
# Q2 2024 Outcomes

## Outcome 1: Reduce Enterprise Churn by 50%
**Problem**: Losing 3 enterprise accounts/quarter = $1.2M ARR lost. Exit interviews cite "missing enterprise features"
**Success Metric**: Enterprise churn 2% → 1% by end of Q2
**Approach**: SSO integration, advanced permissions, audit logs, dedicated success program
**Confidence**: High (validated with customers, solutions known)

## Outcome 2: Accelerate Trial-to-Paid Conversion
**Problem**: 60% of trials never activate (don't see value fast enough)
**Success Metric**: Trial→Paid conversion 15% → 25% by end of Q2
**Approach**: Redesign onboarding, add templates/examples, improve first-run experience
**Confidence**: Medium (problem validated, testing solutions)

## Outcome 3: Enable Upmarket Expansion
**Problem**: $5M in pipeline blocked by missing enterprise features
**Success Metric**: Close 10 enterprise deals (>$100K ACV) in Q2
**Approach**: Enterprise feature set (SSO, permissions, compliance), sales enablement
**Confidence**: High (clear customer demand, features defined)

## Why Outcome-Based?

**Benefits**:
- Clear success criteria
- Measurable results
- Strategic focus
- Team autonomy (how to achieve)

**vs Feature Roadmap**:
- Bad: "Build SSO, dashboards, mobile app"
- Good: "Reduce churn, improve conversion, enable expansion"

---

**Key Principle**: Outcomes show where you're going, features are how you might get there. Outcomes are fixed, features are flexible.
