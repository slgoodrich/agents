## Four Main Roadmap Types

### 1. Now-Next-Later

**Structure**: Three buckets (Now, Next, Later) without dates

**Best for**: Maximum flexibility, avoiding commitments

**Pros**:
- No date pressure
- Easy to adjust
- Clear focus

**Cons**:
- Vague on timing
- Hard to plan dependencies
- May frustrate team members wanting dates

**Use when**: High uncertainty, fast-changing priorities, want flexibility

---

### 2. Theme-Based

**Structure**: Strategic themes with grouped initiatives

**Best for**: Strategic communication, outcome focus

**Pros**:
- Strategic clarity
- Outcome-oriented
- Flexible within themes

**Cons**:
- Less specific
- Harder to sequence
- May miss dependencies

**Use when**: Communicating to executives, aligning on strategy

### 3. Outcome-Based

**Structure**: Results (outcomes) we want, approaches flexible

**Best for**: Results-driven teams, goal-driven culture

**Pros**:
- Clear success criteria
- Measurable
- Team autonomy

**Cons**:
- Requires strong metrics
- Less prescriptive
- May be too abstract for execution

**Use when**: Goal-driven company, mature teams, clear metrics

---

### 4. Timeline

**Structure**: Initiatives plotted on calendar/quarters

**Best for**: Internal planning, dependencies

**Pros**:
- Clear sequencing
- Shows dependencies
- Resource planning

**Cons**:
- Creates date expectations
- Less flexible
- Can be seen as commitments

**Use when**: Internal only, complex dependencies, stable priorities

---

## Choosing the Right Type

**Solo operator / Small team**: Now-Next-Later (simple, flexible)

**Startup / High uncertainty**: Now-Next-Later or Theme-based

**Growth company**: Theme-based or Outcome-based

**Enterprise / Complex**: Outcome-based or Timeline (internal)

---

## Hybrid Approaches

**Common combos**:
- Now-Next-Later + Themes (flexible with strategic clarity)
- Outcome-based + Timeline (results + sequencing)
- Different formats for different audiences

---

**Key Principle**: Match roadmap type to your context - company stage, uncertainty level, audience needs.
