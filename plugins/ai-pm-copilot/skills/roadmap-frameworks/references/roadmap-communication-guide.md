# Roadmap Communication Guide

How to tailor and communicate roadmaps to different audiences.

---

## Audience-Specific Roadmaps

### Executive Roadmap

**Focus**: Strategy, business outcomes, resource needs

**Include**:

- Strategic themes
- Business impact (revenue, cost, risk)
- Resource requirements
- Key milestones

**Format**: Themes + outcomes
**Timeframe**: Annual + quarterly
**Detail**: Low (strategic)

---

### Customer Roadmap

**Focus**: Value delivery, transparency

**Include**:

- Customer-facing improvements
- Problems being solved
- Rough timeframes (Now/Next/Later)

**Exclude**:

- Internal work (tech debt, infrastructure)
- Competitive details
- Hard dates

**Format**: Now-Next-Later with problem framing
**Language**: Customer problems, not features

---

### Sales Roadmap

**Focus**: Deal enablement, competitive positioning

**Include**:

- Features that close deals
- Competitive gaps
- Confidence levels
- Positioning guidance

**Guidance**: "Commit to Now, position Next as likely, describe Later as exploring"

---

### Engineering/Team Roadmap

**Focus**: Execution, technical detail

**Include**:

- Technical initiatives
- Dependencies
- Resource allocation
- Tech debt work

**Format**: Timeline with dependencies
**Detail**: High (sprint-plannable)

## Communication Tactics

### Quarterly All-Hands (30 min)

**Structure**:

1. Context (5 min): Company goals, how roadmap supports
2. Roadmap (10 min): Now (detail), Next (medium), Later (high-level)
3. Trade-offs (5 min): What we're NOT doing and why
4. Q&A (10 min)

---

### Update Communication

**When roadmap changes**:

Format:

```
Roadmap Update: [Date]

What Changed:
- [Change 1]: [Why]

What Stayed:
- [Core theme]: Still priority because...

Impact: [Who this affects]
```

**When to send**: Only material changes, not minor adjustments

---

## Communication Anti-Patterns

**Don't**:

- Use same roadmap for all audiences
- Make sudden changes without communication
- Over-promise to close deals
- Use internal jargon with customers
- Commit to dates externally

**Do**:

- Tailor to audience
- Communicate changes proactively
- Under-promise, over-deliver
- Use customer language
- Provide timeframes, not dates

---

**Key Principle**: Different audiences need different views. Tailor format, detail level, and language to each audience's needs.
