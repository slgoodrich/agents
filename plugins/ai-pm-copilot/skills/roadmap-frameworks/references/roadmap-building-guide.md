# Roadmap Building Guide

7-step process for building strategic, aligned roadmaps.

---

## Step 1: Establish Strategy

**Before roadmap, clarify**:

- Company goals (what we're achieving)
- Product strategy (where we play, how we win)
- Market position (competitive context)
- Constraints (resources, time, dependencies)

**Output**: Strategic context document

---

## Step 2: Gather Inputs

**Sources**:

- Customer feedback (VoC, research, support tickets)
- Business priorities (sales blockers, ops needs)
- Technical needs (eng, infrastructure, security)
- Competitive intelligence (market trends, competitors)
- Data/analytics (usage, churn, engagement)

**Output**: Comprehensive list of opportunities/problems

---

## Step 3: Prioritize

**Framework**: RICE, Impact/Effort, Strategic Fit

**For each opportunity, assess**:

- Customer impact (how many, how much)
- Business impact (revenue, cost, risk)
- Strategic alignment (fits strategy?)
- Effort (time, resources, complexity)

**Output**: Priority-ordered list

---

## Step 4: Define Themes

**Group opportunities into 3-5 strategic themes**

**Good themes are**:

- Customer-centric (not tech-centric)
- Strategic (support company goals)
- Measurable (clear success metrics)
- Focused (not too many)

**Example**:
Theme: "Enterprise Readiness"

- SSO, permissions, audit logs, compliance

**Output**: 3-5 themes with grouped initiatives

---

## Step 5: Sequence

**Consider**:

- Dependencies (what must come first)
- Resources (who's available when)
- Strategic timing (market windows, customer commitments)
- Value delivery (quick wins vs long bets)

**Techniques**:

- Now-Next-Later buckets
- Quarterly swimlanes
- Dependency mapping

**Output**: Sequenced roadmap

---

## Step 6: Validate & Align

**Review with**:

- Executives: Strategic alignment?
- Engineering: Feasible?
- Sales/CS: Customer impact?
- Customers: Validates their needs? (select customers)

**Iterate based on feedback**

**Output**: Aligned roadmap

---

## Step 7: Communicate

**Create audience-specific views**:

- Executive: Strategic themes
- Team: Detailed timeline
- Customer: Now-Next-Later
- Sales: Deal enablement

**Roll out**:

- All-hands presentation
- Written documentation
- Regular updates (quarterly)

**Output**: Communicated, aligned organization

---

## Maintenance

**Weekly**: Review progress, adjust "Now"
**Monthly**: Validate "Next", refine "Later"
**Quarterly**: Build next quarter roadmap

---

**Key Principle**: Roadmaps are living documents. Plan quarterly, review monthly, adjust weekly.
