## Core Principle: Validated Learning

**Traditional approach**: Build → Launch → Learn if it works

**Lean Startup approach**: Learn → Build → Measure → Learn (repeat)

**Key insight**: The goal isn't to build a product. It's to learn how to build a sustainable business as quickly as possible.

### Validated Learning vs. Opinions

**Validated learning** is empirical evidence that you're making progress toward your goals.

**Not validated learning**:

- "Users would love this" (opinion)
- "10 people said they'd use it" (cheap talk)
- "We got great feedback" (vanity metric)

**Validated learning**:

- "50% of users returned on day 7" (behavior)
- "20% converted to paid after trial" (commitment)
- "Users spent average 15 min per session" (engagement)

## The Build-Measure-Learn Loop

The core engine of Lean Startup.

```
Ideas → Build → Product → Measure → Data → Learn → Ideas (repeat)
```

### The Paradox: Start with Learn

Though the loop flows Build → Measure → Learn, **start planning from the end**:

1. **What do we want to learn?** (Learning goal)
2. **What data would teach us that?** (Metrics)
3. **What must we build to get that data?** (MVP)

---

### 1. Learn: Define the Leap of Faith

**Leap-of-faith assumptions**: The riskiest assumptions your business depends on.

**Example for Netflix (early days)**:

- Leap 1: "People will rent DVDs by mail" (vs. going to Blockbuster)
- Leap 2: "Mailing DVDs won't damage them"
- Leap 3: "People will return DVDs on time"

**Your leap-of-faith assumptions**:

- What must be true for your business to work?
- Which assumption, if wrong, kills the business?
- What are you least confident about?

**Start here**: Identify your leaps of faith before building anything.

---

### 2. Measure: Define Actionable Metrics

**What you'll measure to test the assumption:**

**Actionable metrics** (good):

- Directly tied to specific actions
- Comparable over time
- Accessible to team
- Auditable (can verify)

**Vanity metrics** (bad):

- Impressive numbers with no action
- Growth without context
- Can't be replicated

**Example transformation**:

- Vanity: "10,000 signups!" → Can't tell if that's good, what drove it, or what to do
- Actionable: "30% of users from blog posts activated vs 10% from ads" → Know what works, can optimize

---

### 3. Build: Create Minimum Viable Product

**MVP is not**:

- The crappiest version of your vision
- A prototype
- A beta with bugs

**MVP is**:

- The minimum thing you can build to run your experiment
- Designed to test specific assumptions
- Often embarrassingly simple

**Key question**: "What's the least we can build to test if we're right?"

---

## Types of MVPs

### 1. Concierge MVP

**What**: Manually deliver the service to a small number of customers

**Example**:

- Food on the Table (meal planning service)
- Founder personally helped 1 customer plan meals each week
- Learned what customers valued before building technology

**When to use**:

- Testing if the outcome is valuable
- Before building automation
- Understanding what "done right" looks like

**Cost**: Low tech, high time
**Speed**: Days to start
**Learning**: Deep understanding of user needs

---

### 2. Wizard of Oz MVP

**What**: Build frontend, fake the backend (humans do it manually)

**Example**:

- Zappos (early days)
- Posted photos of shoes from local stores
- When ordered, went to store, bought shoes, mailed them
- Validated demand before inventory investment

**When to use**:

- Backend is expensive/time-consuming to build
- Want to test user behavior with "real" product
- Validating full user experience

**Cost**: Medium tech, medium time
**Speed**: Weeks
**Learning**: Real usage patterns

---

### 3. Landing Page MVP

**What**: Marketing page describing product, measure interest

**Example**:

- Dropbox video demo
- Showed product working (before it fully worked)
- Beta signup list grew from 5,000 to 75,000 overnight
- Validated demand before full build

**When to use**:

- Very early demand validation
- Before building anything
- Testing value proposition messaging

**Cost**: Very low
**Speed**: Days
**Learning**: Interest level (not usage)

---

### 4. Single-Feature MVP

**What**: Build only the most critical feature

**Example**:

- Twitter's MVP
- Just posting 140-character updates
- No replies, no retweets, no images
- Validated core behavior (people will share short thoughts)

**When to use**:

- Multi-feature product idea
- One feature is the core value
- Other features are nice-to-have

**Cost**: Low to medium
**Speed**: Weeks to month
**Learning**: Core value validation

---

### 5. Fake Door / Painted Door MVP

**What**: Add button/feature that doesn't exist, measure clicks

**Example**:

- Add "Export to Excel" button
- When clicked, show "Coming soon, want to be notified?"
- Measure how many people wanted it

**When to use**:

- Testing interest in new feature
- Prioritizing roadmap
- Inside existing product

**Cost**: Very low
**Speed**: Hours to days
**Learning**: Interest in specific feature

**Ethics note**: Always be transparent - don't let users think feature is broken

---

### 6. Piecemeal MVP

**What**: Combine existing tools/services to fake a complete product

**Example**:

- Groupon v1
- Used WordPress blog + email + PDF coupons
- Tested if people would buy group deals
- Before building marketplace platform

**When to use**:

- Can accomplish outcome with existing tools
- Want to validate business model
- Technical build would be expensive

**Cost**: Very low
**Speed**: Days
**Learning**: Full business model validation

---

## Pivot or Persevere

After running experiments, make one of two decisions:

### Persevere

Continue current strategy, assumptions are validated

**When to persevere**:

- Hitting success metrics consistently
- Learning is confirming hypotheses
- Growth is on track
- Product-market fit signals emerging

---

### Pivot

Change fundamental strategy based on learnings

**When to pivot**:

- Not hitting success metrics despite iterations
- Assumptions proven wrong
- Better opportunity discovered
- Stuck in "land of the living dead" (not growing, not dying)

---

## Types of Pivots

### 1. Zoom-in Pivot

**What**: Single feature becomes whole product

**Example**:

- Instagram started as Burbn (location check-in app)
- Photo-sharing feature was most used
- Pivoted to just photo-sharing

**When**: Users love one feature, ignore the rest

---

### 2. Zoom-out Pivot

**What**: Product becomes single feature of larger product

**Example**:

- Started as photo editing tool
- Became part of larger design platform

**When**: Feature is insufficient standalone, but valuable as part of larger whole

---

### 3. Customer Segment Pivot

**What**: Same product, different customer

**Example**:

- Slack started as gaming company internal tool
- Pivoted to selling team communication tool to companies
- Same product, completely different customer

**When**: Product solves problem for unexpected audience better than intended audience

---

### 4. Customer Need Pivot

**What**: Different problem for same customer

**Example**:

- Potbelly Sandwich Shop started as antique store
- Realized customers came for sandwiches, not antiques
- Pivoted to restaurant

**When**: Discover customers have different, more important need

---

### 5. Platform Pivot

**What**: Application becomes platform (or vice versa)

**Example**:

- YouTube started as video dating site
- Became video sharing platform
- Eventually added applications (channels, ads)

**When**: More value in enabling others than doing it yourself

---

### 6. Business Architecture Pivot

**What**: High margin/low volume → Low margin/high volume (or vice versa)

**Example**:

- Enterprise software → Consumer product
- One-time sale → Subscription

**When**: Economics don't work at current volume/margin combination

---

### 7. Value Capture Pivot

**What**: Change how you make money

**Example**:

- Paid product → Freemium
- Direct sales → Marketplace take rate
- Ad-supported → Subscription

**When**: Creating value but not capturing it, or better monetization method discovered

---

### 8. Engine of Growth Pivot

**What**: Change growth strategy

**Example**:

- Viral → Paid acquisition
- Organic → Sales-driven
- User growth → Revenue growth

**When**: Current growth engine not sustainable or efficient

---

### 9. Channel Pivot

**What**: Different distribution channel

**Example**:

- Direct to consumer → Through retailers
- Web → Mobile
- Self-service → Sales team

**When**: Different channel offers better economics or reach

---

### 10. Technology Pivot

**What**: Same solution, different technology

**Example**:

- Manual process → Automated
- Cloud-based → On-premise
- Web → Native app

**When**: Better technology available for same solution

---

## Innovation Accounting

Track progress when traditional metrics (revenue, profit) don't apply yet.

### The Three Learning Milestones

**1. Establish the Baseline**

- Build MVP
- Measure current reality
- Get real data (not assumptions)

**Example**:

- Landing page converts 2% of visitors
- 10% of trials activate
- 30-day retention is 15%

---

**2. Tune the Engine**

- Make incremental improvements
- Measure impact
- Move metrics toward ideal

**Example**:

- Improve onboarding → activation rises to 20%
- Better targeting → conversion rises to 5%
- Email campaign → retention rises to 25%

---

**3. Pivot or Persevere**

- Decide if tuning is working
- If metrics improving → persevere
- If stuck → pivot

**Example**:

- After 3 months of tuning, retention stuck at 25%
- Target was 40%
- Not growing fast enough
- → Pivot

---

## Product-Market Fit Validation

How do you know when you've found product-market fit?

### Quantitative Signals

**Growth**:

- Organic growth without marketing spend
- Word-of-mouth driving signups
- Retention curves flattening (not decaying to zero)

**Engagement**:

- Users returning frequently
- Session lengths increasing
- Feature adoption growing

**Economics**:

- LTV > CAC (3:1 ratio ideally)
- Payback period reasonable
- Unit economics positive

---

### Qualitative Signals

**Marc Andreessen's test**:
"You can always feel when product/market fit isn't happening. The customers aren't quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn't spreading, usage isn't growing that fast."

**And when it is happening**:

- Users get upset when product goes down
- Can't hire support fast enough
- Servers melting from usage
- Sales is easy (pulling rope, not pushing)

**Sean Ellis test**:
Survey users: "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"

- Product-market fit: > 40% say "very disappointed"

---

## Common Lean Startup Mistakes

### 1. Building Too Much

**Mistake**: "MVP should still be great, so let's add features"

**Reality**: MVP should test assumptions, not impress

**Fix**: Always ask "What's the minimum to learn?"

---

### 2. Measuring Vanity Metrics

**Mistake**: Celebrating signups, not retention

**Reality**: Growth without engagement is a leaky bucket

**Fix**: Track cohort retention, activation, meaningful engagement

---

### 3. Ignoring Negative Data

**Mistake**: "Those users just didn't get it"

**Reality**: If users don't get it, that's the problem

**Fix**: Seek disconfirming evidence, don't rationalize failure

---

### 4. Pivoting Too Fast

**Mistake**: Pivot every week based on limited data

**Reality**: Need enough data to learn

**Fix**: Set clear success criteria and timeline before starting

---

### 5. Pivoting Too Slow

**Mistake**: Keep tuning for months with no progress

**Reality**: Sometimes the strategy is just wrong

**Fix**: Set decision deadlines, be honest about lack of progress

---

### 6. Skipping Customer Development

**Mistake**: Build MVP without talking to users first

**Reality**: MVP tests assumptions, but you need to know what to assume

**Fix**: Customer interviews before MVP, not after

---

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### Lean Startup + Continuous Discovery (Teresa Torres)

**Continuous Discovery**: Weekly user research becomes your learning loop
**Lean Startup**: Build-Measure-Learn applied to weekly cadence
**Combined**: Continuous evidence flow, continuous pivoting

---

### Lean Startup + Jobs to Be Done

**JTBD**: Understand the job users hire product for
**Lean Startup**: Test if your product gets hired for that job
**Combined**: Validate you're solving the right job in the right way

---

### Lean Startup + Design Thinking

**Design Thinking**: Ideate many solutions
**Lean Startup**: Test solutions quickly
**Combined**: Diverge (many ideas) → Converge (test best ones)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Learning is the goal**, not building
2. **Start with assumptions**, then test them
3. **Build minimum** to run experiment
4. **Measure behavior**, not opinions
5. **Pivot when stuck**, persevere when progressing
6. **Speed matters** - learn fast, fail fast
7. **Customer contact** is essential throughout
