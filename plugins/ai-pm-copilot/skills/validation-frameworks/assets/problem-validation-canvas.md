## Section 7: Validation Experiments

### How will you validate this problem?

**Experiments to run**:

#### Experiment 1: Customer Discovery Interviews

- **Goal**: Confirm problem exists and is painful
- **Method**: Interview 10-15 target users
- **Questions to ask**:
  1. Tell me about last time you [relevant situation]
  2. What was frustrating about that?
  3. What do you currently do to solve this?
  4. How much time/money does this cost you?
- **Success criteria**: 7+ / 10 express significant pain
- **Timeline**: **\_\_\_\_** weeks
- **Status**: [ ] Planned [ ] In progress [ ] Complete

**Results**:

---

#### Experiment 2: Observation

- **Goal**: See problem in real context
- **Method**: Shadow users or review screen recordings
- **What to observe**:

  - What they do when it happens
  - Emotional reactions
  - Time spent on workarounds
- **Success criteria**: ******\_\_\_\_******
- **Timeline**: **\_\_\_\_** weeks

## Section 8: Validation Checklist

### Problem Validation Gate

Before moving to solution validation, confirm:

- [ ] Problem is real (observed/reported by multiple users)
- [ ] Problem is painful (users express frustration, wasting time/money)
- [ ] Problem is common (affects significant % of target segment)
- [ ] Problem is frequent (happens regularly, not one-time)
- [ ] Existing solutions are inadequate (gap in market)
- [ ] Users are motivated to solve it (actively seeking solutions)
- [ ] Users would pay to solve it (or you have other business model)
- [ ] You can reach these users (accessible market)

**Green lights** (4+ checked): Strong validation, proceed to solution validation
**Yellow lights** (2-3 checked): Moderate validation, need more evidence or narrow focus
**Red lights** (0-1 checked): Weak validation, consider different problem

## Tips for Using This Canvas

### Do's:

- Talk to at least 10 users before completing this
- Seek disconfirming evidence (try to prove yourself wrong)
- Focus on behaviors, not opinions
- Ask about past behavior, not hypothetical futures
- Update this as you learn more

### Don'ts:

- Don't assume you know the problem without user contact
- Don't confuse solution ideas with problem validation
- Don't ask leading questions in interviews
- Don't cherry-pick positive feedback
- Don't proceed to solution with weak problem validation

---

**Remember**: A well-validated problem is halfway to a successful product. Take the time to truly understand the problem before jumping to solutions.
