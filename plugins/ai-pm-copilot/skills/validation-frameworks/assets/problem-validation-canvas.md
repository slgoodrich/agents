## Section 8: Validation Checklist

### Problem Validation Gate

Before moving to solution validation, confirm:

- [ ] Problem is real (observed/reported by multiple users)
- [ ] Problem is painful (users express frustration, wasting time/money)
- [ ] Problem is common (affects significant % of target segment)
- [ ] Problem is frequent (happens regularly, not one-time)
- [ ] Existing solutions are inadequate (gap in market)
- [ ] Users are motivated to solve it (actively seeking solutions)
- [ ] Users would pay to solve it (or you have other business model)
- [ ] You can reach these users (accessible market)

**Green lights** (4+ checked): Strong validation, proceed to solution validation
**Yellow lights** (2-3 checked): Moderate validation, need more evidence or narrow focus
**Red lights** (0-1 checked): Weak validation, consider different problem

## Tips for Using This Canvas

### Do's:
- Talk to at least 10 users before completing this
- Seek disconfirming evidence (try to prove yourself wrong)
- Focus on behaviors, not opinions
- Ask about past behavior, not hypothetical futures
- Update this as you learn more

### Don'ts:
- Don't assume you know the problem without user contact
- Don't confuse solution ideas with problem validation
- Don't ask leading questions in interviews
- Don't cherry-pick positive feedback
- Don't proceed to solution with weak problem validation

---

**Remember**: A well-validated problem is halfway to a successful product. Take the time to truly understand the problem before jumping to solutions.
