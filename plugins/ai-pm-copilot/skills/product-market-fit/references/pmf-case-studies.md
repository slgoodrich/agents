## Superhuman: Systematic PMF Improvement

**Category:** B2B SaaS (Email client)
**Founded:** 2015
**PMF Achieved:** 2017-2018
**Outcome:** Successful scale, $33M Series B

### The Journey

**Starting Point (2015-2017):**

- Built fast email client for power users
- Beautiful design, keyboard shortcuts
- Invite-only beta
- **Initial PMF score: 22%** (Below threshold)

**Problem Recognized:**

- Knew they needed 40%+ to scale
- But had product in market, users were using it
- Needed systematic improvement, not pivot

---

### The Superhuman PMF Engine

**Rahul Vohra's Approach:**

**Step 1: Segment Users (Q1 2017)**

```
Survey results:
- 22% "Very disappointed"
- 52% "Somewhat disappointed"
- 26% "Not disappointed"

Analysis: Only 22% are champions, need to grow this
```

**Step 2: Analyze Champions**

```
Who are the "very disappointed" users?

Found: VCs, executives, founders
- Common trait: 100+ emails per day
- Use case: Need "inbox zero" daily
- Alternatives: Gmail (too slow, cluttered)
- Why Superhuman: Blazing fast, keyboard-driven

Insight: We have PMF with high-volume email power users
```

**Step 3: Understand Others**

```
"Somewhat disappointed" users:
- Similar personas to champions
- Missing features preventing full value
- Gaps: Calendar integration, mobile app, specific integrations

"Not disappointed" users:
- Casual email users (<20 emails/day)
- Don't need speed/power features
- Wrong segment for us

Decision: Ignore "not disappointed", focus on converting "somewhat"
```

**Step 4: Build Roadmap**

```
50% of roadmap: Make champions even happier
- Faster performance
- More keyboard shortcuts
- Better search
- Deeper integrations

50% of roadmap: Convert "somewhat disappointed"
- Calendar integration
- Mobile app
- Missing integrations they requested
- Onboarding improvements

0% of roadmap: Don't build for casual users
```

---

### The Results

**Quarterly PMF Scores:**

```
Q1 2017: 22%  (Baseline)
Q2 2017: 33%  (+11%)
Q3 2017: 40%  (+7%, Hit threshold!)
Q4 2017: 48%  (+8%)
Q1 2018: 52%  (+4%)
Q2 2018: 58%  (+6%)

18 months: 22% → 58% = 2.6x improvement
```

**What Changed:**

```
Early 2017:
- Slow for some users
- Missing integrations
- No calendar
- No mobile
- Complex onboarding

Mid 2018:
- Blazing fast for everyone
- Key integrations built
- Calendar integrated
- Mobile app shipped
- Onboarding streamlined
```

---

### Key Lessons

**Lesson 1: PMF is measurable and improvable**

- Not binary (yes/no), it's a spectrum
- Can systematically increase score
- Data-driven beats intuition

**Lesson 2: Focus on champions**

- The "very disappointed" users are your future
- Make them even happier first
- Don't dilute for wrong segment

**Lesson 3: Strategic roadmap allocation**

- 50% strengthen core (champions)
- 50% convert warm (similar users)
- 0% chase wrong users

**Lesson 4: Takes time**

- 18 months to go from 22% → 58%
- Quarterly iteration cycle
- Patient, systematic approach

**Lesson 5: Maintained discipline**

- Stayed invite-only until 58% PMF
- Didn't rush to scale
- Built infrastructure for 10x first
- Then opened floodgates

---

### Applying to Your Product

**If your PMF score is low (<40%):**

1. Run Sean Ellis survey
2. Segment responses
3. Analyze champions deeply
4. Build 50/50 roadmap
5. Re-survey quarterly
6. Track progress systematically

**Timeline expectation:**

- 6-12 months to reach 40%+ (if close already)
- 12-18 months if starting from <30%
- Faster than pivot, slower than hope

## Slack: Maintaining PMF Through Evolution

**Category:** B2B SaaS (Team communication)
**Founded:** 2013
**PMF Achieved:** 2014
**Outcome:** $27B acquisition by Salesforce (2021)

### The Origin Story

**Initial Context:**

- Originally: Tiny Speck (gaming company)
- Building MMO game
- Internal tool for team chat
- Game failed, but chat tool worked

**The Pivot (2013):**

```
Recognition:
- Team used internal chat tool obsessively
- External interest when people saw it
- Gaming market hard, enterprise easier
- Pivot to selling the tool

Launch: August 2013
```

---

### Finding Initial PMF (2013-2014)

**Target Segment: Tech companies**

- Started with tech/gaming industry (familiar territory)
- Teams of 10-100 people
- Early adopters of new tools
- Pain: Email overload, fragmented communication

**PMF Signals:**

```
Within 6 months:
- 15,000 daily active users
- 0 churn (literally, no one leaving)
- 93% retention after 30 days
- Organic growth (word-of-mouth)
- Teams recruiting teammates

Metrics:
- 2,000% message growth in first year
- 30-50% month-over-month growth
```

**What drove PMF:**

- Searchable history (vs Hipchat)
- Integrations ecosystem
- Beautiful, fun design
- "Just works" reliability
- Fast product iteration

---

### Scaling While Maintaining PMF (2014-2018)

**Expansion Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Tech startups (2014)**

- Core segment, strong PMF
- Natural viral growth
- Product-led growth working

**Phase 2: SMBs in other industries (2015-2016)**

- Horizontal expansion
- Marketing, sales, operations teams
- Maintained core value (searchable messaging)
- Added features for new use cases

**Phase 3: Mid-market (2016-2017)**

- Larger teams (100-1,000 people)
- Added: Better admin controls, SSO, compliance
- Without bloating SMB experience

**Phase 4: Enterprise (2017-2020)**

- Fortune 500 companies
- Major feature additions: Enterprise Grid, EKM, data residency
- Separate SKU (didn't force on SMBs)

---

### How They Maintained PMF

**Strategy 1: Protect Core Value**

```
Core value never changed:
"Searchable, organized team communication"

Everything else = variations on theme
- Better search
- Better organization (channels, threads)
- Better integrations
- Better reliability

Never lost sight of core
```

**Strategy 2: Progressive Enhancement**

```
Don't break existing users when adding for new segments:

SMB → Enterprise example:
- ✓ Add: Enterprise Grid (separate product)
- ✓ Add: Advanced admin (opt-in)
- ✗ Don't: Force complex permissioning on SMBs
- ✗ Don't: Slow down product for scale
```

**Strategy 3: Continuous Customer Development**

```
Maintained:
- Weekly customer interviews
- Active community engagement
- Founder (Stewart Butterfield) in product discussions
- Data-driven decision making

Never stopped learning from users
```

**Strategy 4: Speed Over Perfection**

```
Shipping cadence:
- Weekly releases (early days)
- Biweekly releases (scale)
- Fast iteration maintained

Culture:
- "Make something people want"
- Ship, learn, iterate
- Don't overthink
```

---

### Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1: Feature Bloat Risk**

```
Problem: Hundreds of feature requests
Solution:
- Said no to most
- Focus on core workflows
- Regular feature pruning
- Separate advanced features
```

**Challenge 2: Enterprise vs SMB Tension**

```
Problem: Enterprise needs ≠ SMB needs
Solution:
- Separate products (Slack vs Enterprise Grid)
- Don't force enterprise features on SMBs
- Maintained simplicity for small teams
```

**Challenge 3: Competition (Microsoft Teams)**

```
Problem: Microsoft bundled Teams with Office 365
Solution:
- Doubled down on differentiation
- Better integrations
- Superior experience
- Focused on engaged users, not just installs

Result: Maintained PMF despite massive competitor
```

## Quibi: Cautionary Tale of No PMF

**Category:** B2C (Short-form video streaming)
**Founded:** 2018
**Launched:** April 2020
**Shutdown:** December 2020
**Outcome:** $1.75B raised, complete failure

### The Setup

**Team:**

- Jeffrey Katzenberg (Hollywood legend)
- Meg Whitman (ex-HP, ex-eBay CEO)
- $1.75 billion raised before launch
- A-list talent and content

**Value Proposition:**

- "Quick bites" of premium content
- 10-minute episodes
- Mobile-only
- Designed for on-the-go watching

**Thesis:**

```
Target: Young adults (18-35)
Use case: Watching during "in-between moments"
- Commuting
- Waiting in line
- Lunch breaks
- Exercise

Belief: Gap in market for premium short-form content
```

---

### The Reality

**Launch (April 2020):**

```
Timing: COVID pandemic (worst possible)
- No commuting
- No "in-between moments"
- People home with time for long-form
- Use case evaporated

Initial downloads: 3.5M (decent)
Free trial conversions: ~8% (terrible)
Retention: ~10% after 30 days (disaster)
```

**The Problems:**

**Problem 1: No Product-Market Fit**

```
Users didn't want:
- 10-minute episodes (want full shows)
- Mobile-only (want TV/desktop)
- Premium price ($8/month)
- Locked portrait/landscape (annoying)

Alternatives better:
- YouTube: Free, unlimited content
- Netflix: Premium shows, any device
- TikTok: Short-form, free, better algorithm
```

**Problem 2: Wrong Customer Discovery**

```
Assumptions based on:
- Investor pitches (not user research)
- Hollywood logic (not tech/product logic)
- Executive intuition (not data)

Reality:
- Never validated with users
- Built for 18 months before launch
- No MVP, no iteration
- Assumed they knew what users wanted
```

**Problem 3: No Feedback Loop**

```
After launch:
- Poor retention
- Low engagement
- Users complaining
- Asked for TV app, landscape mode

Response:
- Too slow to adapt
- Added TV app (August, 4 months late)
- Fixed landscape (September, 5 months late)
- By then, users gone
```

---

### The Metrics

```
Downloads: 5M+
Active users (Month 2): <0.5M (90% churn!)
Conversion rate: 8% (vs 25%+ for successful streaming)
Time spent: <15 min/day (vs 2+ hours Netflix)
NPS: Likely negative (terrible reviews)

Burn rate: $100M+ per month
Revenue: <$5M total

PMF Score: Would have been <10% "very disappointed"
```

---

### Why It Failed

**Failure 1: Built for 18 months without validation**

- Classic "build it and they will come"
- No MVP, no testing
- Assumed Hollywood expertise = product expertise

**Failure 2: Wrong problem**

- "In-between moments" not a problem people had
- Plenty of content for those moments (TikTok, Twitter, etc.)
- Premium short-form not valued

**Failure 3: Wrong solution**

- Mobile-only (people want flexibility)
- Portrait-only initially (annoying constraint)
- Expensive (better free alternatives)

**Failure 4: Timing**

- Launched during pandemic
- Use case eliminated
- Bad luck, but also:
- Had they tested pre-launch, would have known

**Failure 5: No iteration culture**

- Took 4-5 months to ship obvious fixes
- No rapid iteration
- Too corporate, not startup
- Couldn't adapt fast enough

---

### What Should Have Been Done

**Pre-launch (2018-2020):**

```
Instead of:
- Building for 18 months in secret
- Raising $1.75B without product
- Launching with fanfare

Should have:
- Built MVP in 3 months
- Tested with 100 users
- Validated use case
- Iterated based on feedback
- Launched smaller, learned faster
```

**Post-launch (April-August 2020):**

```
Instead of:
- Slow feature additions
- Hoping for turnaround
- Burning $100M+/month

Should have:
- Emergency pivot
- Fast iteration
- Listen to user feedback
- Consider free tier
- Or shut down faster
```

---

### Key Lessons

**Lesson 1: You can't skip PMF validation**

- Doesn't matter how much money you raise
- Doesn't matter how experienced the team
- Doesn't matter how good the content
- Without PMF, nothing else matters

**Lesson 2: Build, measure, learn**

- MVP first, not 18-month build
- Test assumptions early
- Iterate based on feedback
- Don't assume you know

**Lesson 3: Timing matters**

- Market conditions change
- Use cases disappear
- Can't force adoption

**Lesson 4: Listen to users**

- They told Quibi what was wrong
- Quibi fixed it too slowly
- Speed of learning matters

**Lesson 5: Money can't buy PMF**

- $1.75B couldn't save Quibi
- PMF achieved through customer understanding
- Not through capital or celebrity

---

### The Contrast: TikTok

**Why TikTok succeeded where Quibi failed:**

```
TikTok:
- Free (vs $8/month)
- User-generated (vs Hollywood produced)
- Infinite scroll algorithm (vs episodic)
- Social sharing (vs isolated viewing)
- Launched and iterated (vs built then launched)
- Any device (vs mobile-only)

Result: 1B+ users, strong PMF

Lesson: Market chose TikTok's approach over Quibi's
```

## Figma: Remote Work Inflection Point

**Category:** B2B SaaS (Design tool)
**Founded:** 2012
**PMF Achieved:** 2017-2018
**Outcome:** $20B acquisition by Adobe (2022)

### The Long Road to PMF

**Early Years (2012-2016):**

```
Vision: Design tools in browser, real-time collaboration

Challenge:
- Browser technology not ready
- WebGL performance issues
- Competitors entrenched (Sketch desktop dominance)

Progress:

---

### The Remote Work Catalyst (2020)

**Pre-COVID PMF: Strong but not dominant**

```
2019 state:
- Figma: Growing fast
- Sketch: Still market leader
- Adobe XD: Major competitor
- InVision: Strong in handoff

Market share: Figma ~20-30%
```

**COVID Impact: PMF Accelerated**

```
March 2020: Everyone goes remote

Suddenly:
- Real-time collaboration = must-have (was nice-to-have)
- Sketch's desktop-only = dealbreaker
- Figma's browser-based = essential
- Multiplayer editing = differentiator

Market shift:
- Design teams switching en masse
- Figma share surging
- Competitors scrambling
```

**Post-COVID PMF: Dominant**

```
2021-2022:
- Figma: ~60-70% market share
- Sketch: Declining
- Adobe XD: Stagnant
- InVision: Dying

Result:
- $20B acquisition by Adobe
- Market leader by far
- Strong PMF across all segments
```

---

### Key Lessons

**Lesson 1: PMF can take years to find**

- Founded 2012, PMF by 2017 = 5 years
- Technology needed to mature
- Market needed to shift
- Patience + persistence paid off

**Lesson 2: External events can accelerate PMF**

- COVID made collaboration essential
- Figma's differentiation suddenly critical
- Right product, right time
- But had to have product ready

**Lesson 3: Multiplayer is moat**

- Real-time collaboration = network effects
- Team switches together
- Hard to leave (social cost)
- Competitors couldn't replicate

**Lesson 4: Freemium works with strong PMF**

- Free tier for individuals
- Paid for teams
- Product-led growth
- Users recruit users

**Lesson 5: Market timing isn't everything**

- Could have been "too early" in 2012
- But kept building, improving
- Ready when market shifted
- Lucky + prepared = success

---

### Metrics That Mattered

```
Users (2022): 4M+
Organizations: 100K+
Fortune 500: 90%+ using Figma
Revenue: $400M+ ARR
Growth: 100%+ YoY (2020-2021)
Valuation: $20B (acquisition)
PMF Score: Likely 70%+ very disappointed
NPS: 60+
Retention: 90%+ (design teams)
```
