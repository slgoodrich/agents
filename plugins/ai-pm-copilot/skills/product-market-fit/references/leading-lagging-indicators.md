# Leading and Lagging Indicators Guide

Comprehensive guide to using leading and lagging indicators to measure and predict product-market fit.

## Understanding the Difference

**Leading Indicators:**
- Signal PMF before metrics confirm it
- Qualitative and behavioral signals
- Help you "feel" PMF happening
- Predict future metrics
- Actionable in real-time

**Lagging Indicators:**
- Confirm PMF retrospectively
- Quantitative metrics
- Show up in dashboards
- Validate what already happened
- Take time to accumulate

**Why both matter:**
- Leading indicators let you act early
- Lagging indicators prove you were right
- Leading without lagging = false positives
- Lagging without leading = too slow to react

---

## Leading Indicators (Feel It Now)

Signals you can observe and act on immediately, before metrics confirm PMF.

### 1. Organic Growth

**What it is:** Growth that happens without paid acquisition - users finding you through word-of-mouth, search, referrals.

**Why it matters:** If users recommend you unprompted, the product solves a real problem. Organic growth is the purest PMF signal.

#### Measuring Organic Growth

**Referral Rate:**
```
Referral Rate = (New users from referrals / Total active users) × 100

Target: 15-30%+ for strong PMF
```

**Viral Coefficient (K-factor):**
```
K = (# invites per user) × (% accept rate)

Examples:
K > 1.0 = Exponential viral growth (rare)
K = 0.5-1.0 = Strong viral growth
K = 0.2-0.5 = Moderate viral growth
K < 0.2 = Weak viral growth
```

**Organic Signup Ratio:**
```
Organic % = (Organic signups / Total signups) × 100

Strong PMF: >50% organic
Moderate PMF: 25-50% organic
Weak/No PMF: <25% organic
```

**Branded Search Volume:**
Track Google search volume for your brand name:
```
Month over month growth in branded searches

Strong signal: 20%+ monthly growth
```

#### Qualitative Signals of Organic Growth

**Social media mentions (unprompted):**
- Track Twitter, LinkedIn mentions
- Reddit discussions
- Hacker News posts
- Without your prompting

**Community growth:**
- Slack/Discord community size
- User group formation
- Meetups organized by users
- User-generated content

**Inbound interest:**
- Unsolicited press inquiries
- Partnership requests
- Investor inbound
- Job applications

**Examples:**

**Strong Organic Growth (Slack early days):**
- 30%+ signups from referrals
- User-created Slack communities
- Unprompted tweets: "Just switched to Slack, it's amazing"
- Waitlist from word-of-mouth

**Weak Organic Growth:**
- 5% referral rate
- No social mentions
- All signups from paid ads
- No inbound interest

---

### 2. User Engagement Depth

**What it is:** How deeply and frequently users engage with your product.

**Why it matters:** Users who engage deeply have found value. Shallow usage = not a must-have.

#### Engagement Metrics

**DAU/MAU Ratio (Stickiness):**
```
DAU/MAU = (Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users) × 100

Benchmarks:
- B2C Social: 60%+ = strong PMF
- B2B Productivity: 30-40% = good
- Occasional-use products: 10-20% = acceptable
```

**Session Frequency:**
```
Sessions per user per week

High-frequency products: 10+ sessions/week
Medium-frequency: 3-5 sessions/week
Low-frequency: 1-2 sessions/week
```

**Session Length:**
```
Average time per session

Depends on product:
- Communication tools: Short frequent sessions (2-5 min)
- Productivity tools: Longer sessions (30-60 min)
- Entertainment: Very long sessions (60+ min)
```

**Feature Adoption:**
```
% of users who use core features

Strong PMF: 70%+ use core features
Weak PMF: <30% use core features
```

**Power User Percentage:**
```
% of users who are daily/heavy users

Strong products: 20-40% power users
Weak products: <10% power users
```

#### Behavioral Signals

**Returning without prompting:**
- Users come back without email/push
- Directly type URL or open app
- Bookmark product

**Using in multiple contexts:**
- Desktop + mobile
- Work + personal
- Multiple use cases

**Deep feature exploration:**
- Trying advanced features
- Customizing product
- Creating content/data

**Time investment:**
- Spending time learning product
- Creating templates/workflows
- Integrating with other tools

**Examples:**

**Strong Engagement (Notion):**
- DAU/MAU: 35%
- Users creating 10+ pages
- Using templates, databases, integrations
- Spending hours building workspace

**Weak Engagement:**
- DAU/MAU: 5%
- Login once per month
- Only use one basic feature
- Abandon after 2 minutes

---

### 3. Customer Passion

**What it is:** Emotional intensity of user sentiment - do they LOVE it or just tolerate it?

**Why it matters:** Passionate users become champions, drive word-of-mouth, and retain forever. Lukewarm users churn.

#### Measuring Passion

**Qualitative Signals:**

**"Don't take this away" responses:**
Count how many users say:
- "I couldn't live without this"
- "Don't take this away from me"
- "This is essential to my workflow"
- "I'd be lost without it"

**Voluntary evangelism:**
- Writing blog posts about your product
- Creating video tutorials
- Answering questions in community
- Recommending without incentive

**Active participation:**
- Submitting feature requests
- Reporting bugs proactively
- Participating in beta programs
- Attending user events

**Going above and beyond:**
- Creating integrations/plugins
- Building on your API
- Sharing templates/workflows
- Contributing to docs

#### Community Health Signals

**Community engagement rate:**
```
% of users active in community (Slack, Discord, forum)

Strong: 10%+ of users engaged
Moderate: 3-10%
Weak: <3%
```

**Help-to-ask ratio:**
```
Community answers / Questions asked

Healthy: >1.0 (more answers than questions)
Self-sustaining community
```

**User-generated value:**
- Templates created by users
- Tutorials and guides
- Case studies
- Success stories

**Net Promoter Mindset (qualitative):**
Not just NPS score, but actual promotion:
- Unprompted recommendations
- LinkedIn posts about product
- Recruiting teammates
- Speaking at events

#### Examples

**Strong Passion (Superhuman):**
- Users: "Changed how I work"
- Voluntarily creating keyboard shortcut guides
- Recruiting colleagues: "You HAVE to try this"
- Waiting months on waitlist

**Weak Passion:**
- Users: "It's fine"
- No social mentions
- No community activity
- Churning after trial

### 4. Sales Velocity (B2B)

**What it is:** How quickly deals move through sales pipeline.

**Why it matters:** When you have PMF, customers sell themselves. Without PMF, every deal is a struggle.

#### Sales Velocity Metrics

**Average Sales Cycle Length:**
```
Time from first contact to closed deal

Improving PMF:
- Q1: 90 days
- Q2: 60 days
- Q3: 45 days
- Q4: 30 days (←Accelerating = PMF signal)
```

**Win Rate:**
```
Won deals / Total opportunities

Strong PMF: >30% win rate
Moderate: 15-30%
Weak: <15%
```

**Discount Rate:**
```
Average discount given to close deals

Strong PMF: <10% average discount
Weak PMF: >25% discounts needed
```

**Price Objections:**
```
% of deals with price as main objection

Strong PMF: <20% (value is clear)
Weak PMF: >50% (not worth price)
```

**Self-Serve Conversion:**
```
% of trials that convert without sales touch

PLG with strong PMF: 10-20%+
Without PMF: <5%
```

#### Behavioral Signals

**Champion emergence:**
- User becomes internal advocate
- Does your selling for you
- Brings in other team members
- Fights procurement battles

**Pulling, not pushing:**
- Inbound demo requests
- Users asking "when can we start?"
- Pressure to speed up process
- Competitive urgency

**Expansion deals:**
- Existing customers buying more
- Organic upsells
- Cross-sell opportunities
- Multi-year commits

**Examples:**

**Strong Velocity (Figma early days):**
- Designers demoing to leadership
- Sales cycles: 2-4 weeks
- Win rate: 40%+
- Inbound: "How fast can we start?"

**Weak Velocity:**
- 6-month sales cycles
- 10% win rate
- 30%+ discounts needed
- Every deal is a push

---

### 5. Struggle to Keep Up

**What it is:** Demand exceeds supply, you're capacity-constrained.

**Why it matters:** When you have strong PMF, growth constraints are operational (can't hire fast enough) not market-based (nobody wants it).

#### Signals

**Waitlist forming naturally:**
- Users asking "when can I get access?"
- Organic waitlist growth
- FOMO from exclusivity
- Not manufactured scarcity

**Support volume:**
- Ticket volume growing faster than user base
- Users need help getting started (good sign!)
- Feature requests flooding in
- Community very active

**Capacity challenges:**
- Infrastructure struggling with load
- Can't onboard users fast enough
- Support team overwhelmed
- Hiring can't keep up

**Funding attention:**
- Investors reaching out inbound
- Easy fundraising
- Multiple term sheets
- Valuation premium

**Warning:** These can also signal operational problems, not just PMF. Distinguish between "good problem" (demand exceeds capacity) and "bad problem" (poor execution).

#### Examples

**Strong Demand (Superhuman early days):**
- 180,000 person waitlist
- Invite-only for 2+ years
- Infrastructure built deliberately slow
- Users waiting months

**Not PMF, just broken:**
- Can't onboard users (bad UX)
- Support overwhelmed (product bugs)
- Infrastructure failing (technical debt)

---

## Lagging Indicators (Metrics Confirm It)

Hard metrics that accumulate over time and retrospectively confirm PMF.

### 1. Retention

**What it is:** % of users who continue using over time.

**Why it's the ultimate PMF test:** Retention curves reveal if product is truly a must-have. Can't fake retention.

#### Retention Metrics

**Cohort Retention:**
```
% of cohort active after X period

Track by cohort:
- Day 1 → Day 30
- Month 1 → Month 3
- Month 1 → Month 6
```

**Retention Curve Pattern:**
```
Flattening curve = PMF
Continuously declining = No PMF

See retention-curve-analysis.md for details
```

**Churn Rate:**
```
Monthly Churn = Users churned / Starting users

B2C benchmarks:
- <5% monthly: Excellent
- 5-10%: Good
- >10%: Concerning

B2B benchmarks:
- <2% logo churn: Excellent
- <5% revenue churn: Good
- >5%: Concerning
```

**Dollar Retention (B2B):**
```
Net Dollar Retention =
(Starting ARR + Expansions - Churn - Contractions) / Starting ARR

>120%: Best in class (growing despite churn)
100-120%: Strong
90-100%: Acceptable
<90%: Concerning
```

#### Why Retention is Lagging

**Takes time to measure:**
- Need 3-6 months to see curve flatten
- Early data is misleading
- Seasonal effects
- Cohort differences

**But most reliable:**
- Can't be gamed
- Directly measures value
- Predicts long-term success

---

### 2. Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**What it is:** Likelihood users would recommend to others.

**Why it matters:** Correlates strongly with PMF and growth. High NPS predicts word-of-mouth.

#### Calculating NPS

**Survey question:**
> "How likely are you to recommend [Product] to a friend or colleague?"
> Scale: 0 (Not at all likely) to 10 (Extremely likely)

**Categorization:**
- 9-10: Promoters (will recommend)
- 7-8: Passives (satisfied but won't promote)
- 0-6: Detractors (unhappy, may damage brand)

**NPS Calculation:**
```
NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

Example:
60% Promoters - 10% Detractors = 50 NPS
```

#### NPS Benchmarks

**B2B SaaS:**
- 50+: World-class, strong PMF
- 30-50: Good, likely have PMF
- 10-30: Acceptable, improving
- <10: Concerning, may not have PMF
- Negative: No PMF

**B2C:**
- 60+: Exceptional (Apple: 72, Netflix: 68)
- 40-60: Excellent
- 20-40: Good
- <20: Concerning

#### Why NPS is Lagging

**Requires established user base:**
- Need statistically significant sample
- Early users may not be representative
- Takes time to stabilize

**But still valuable:**
- Benchmarkable across companies
- Predicts growth rate
- Segment analysis reveals insights

**NPS by Segment:**
```
Segment A (Target ICP):  NPS +60 (Strong)
Segment B (Adjacent):    NPS +30 (Moderate)
Segment C (Wrong fit):   NPS -10 (No PMF)

Insight: Have PMF with A, not with C
```

### 3. Unit Economics

**What it is:** Economics of acquiring and retaining a customer.

**Why it matters:** Can't scale profitably without working unit economics. Proves sustainable business model.

#### Key Metrics

**LTV (Lifetime Value):**
```
LTV = (Average Revenue per User) × (Average Lifetime in months)

Or more precisely:
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin %) / Monthly Churn Rate

Example:
($100 ARPU × 80% margin) / 5% churn = $1,600 LTV
```

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):**
```
CAC = (Sales + Marketing Spend) / New Customers Acquired

Include:
- Ads spend
- Sales salaries
- Marketing salaries
- Tools and overhead

Example:
$100K spend / 200 customers = $500 CAC
```

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
```
Ratio = LTV / CAC

Benchmarks:
>5:1 = Excellent, scale aggressively
3:1-5:1 = Good, scale sustainably
<3:1 = Needs improvement before scaling
<1:1 = Broken, don't scale
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Months to recover CAC from gross margin

Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin %)

Example:
$500 CAC / ($100 × 80%) = 6.25 months

Benchmarks:
<6 months: Excellent
6-12 months: Good
>12 months: Concerning (unless strategic)
```

**Gross Margin:**
```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue

SaaS benchmarks:
>80%: Excellent
70-80%: Good
<70%: Concerning (or not SaaS)
```

#### Why Unit Economics are Lagging

**Takes time to stabilize:**
- Early CAC artificially high (no scale efficiencies)
- Early LTV uncertain (limited retention data)
- Experimental channels skew results
- Takes 12-18 months to get reliable data

**But critical for scaling:**
- Can't raise growth capital without
- Can't plan profitability without
- Guides channel investment

---

### 4. Growth Rate

**What it is:** How fast you're growing.

**Why it matters:** Strong PMF produces exponential growth. Weak PMF produces linear or no growth.

#### Growth Metrics

**Month-over-Month Growth:**
```
MoM Growth = (This Month - Last Month) / Last Month × 100

Strong PMF:
- Early stage: 15-25% MoM
- Growth stage: 10-15% MoM
- Late stage: 5-10% MoM
```

**Year-over-Year Growth:**
```
YoY Growth = (This Year - Last Year) / Last Year × 100

Benchmarks:
100%+ YoY: Triple digit growth
50-100% YoY: Doubling
30-50% YoY: Healthy growth
<30% YoY: Slower growth
```

**Growth Type:**

**Exponential (Compounding) = Strong PMF:**
```
Month:  1    2    3    4    5    6
Users:  100  120  144  173  208  250 (+20% each month)

Curve: Accelerating upward
```

**Linear = Moderate PMF:**
```
Month:  1    2    3    4    5    6
Users:  100  120  140  160  180  200 (+20 each month)

Curve: Straight line
```

**Flat/Declining = No PMF:**
```
Month:  1    2    3    4    5    6
Users:  100  105  103  108  104  107

Curve: Flat or declining
```

#### Growth Quality

**Not all growth is equal:**

**Organic + Paid (Healthy):**
- 50% organic, 50% paid
- Sustainable and scalable
- Good unit economics

**All Paid (Risky):**
- 100% from paid acquisition
- Stops when you stop paying
- May not have real PMF

**All Viral (Volatile):**
- 100% from referrals/viral
- Can spike then crash
- Hard to control

#### Why Growth is Lagging

**Backward-looking:**
- Shows what already happened
- Doesn't predict future
- Can lag PMF changes by months

**Can be manipulated:**
- Pay for growth (unsustainable)
- Promotions and deals
- One-time events

**But still essential:**
- Proves market exists
- Validates strategy
- Drives valuation

---

### 5. Market Pull

**What it is:** Market actively pulling your product vs. you pushing it.

**Why it matters:** Real PMF creates market pull. Without PMF, everything is a push.

#### Inbound vs. Outbound

**Inbound Ratio:**
```
% of new customers from inbound

Strong PMF: >50% inbound
Moderate: 30-50% inbound
Weak: <30% inbound (mostly outbound)
```

**Types of Inbound:**
- Organic search
- Direct traffic (heard about you)
- Referrals
- Content marketing
- Product-led growth

**Outbound:**
- Cold outbound sales
- Paid advertising
- Purchased leads

#### Brand Strength Signals

**PR and Media:**
- # of press mentions
- Tier of publications (WSJ vs small blog)
- Unsolicited coverage
- Interview requests

**Industry Recognition:**
- Awards and rankings
- Gartner/Forrester mention
- Industry conference invitations
- "Best of" lists

**Competitive Response:**
- Competitors copying features
- Competitive pricing pressure
- Competitors mentioning you in sales
- Job listings mentioning your product

**Market Awareness:**
```
% of TAM who've heard of you

Measured through:
- Surveys
- Branded search volume
- Social listening
- Sales conversations
```

#### Why Market Pull is Lagging

**Builds over time:**
- Brand awareness slow to build
- PR takes months to generate
- Word-of-mouth compounds gradually

**But validates PMF:**
- Market recognizes value
- Competitive position established
- Sustainable advantage

## Using Both Together

### The PMF Dashboard Approach

**Structure:**
```
Primary Metrics (Big 3):
1. Sean Ellis Score (Lagging)
2. Retention Curves (Lagging)
3. NPS (Lagging)

Supporting Leading Indicators:
4. Organic Growth
5. Engagement Depth
6. Customer Passion
7. Sales Velocity
8. Demand Signals

Supporting Lagging Indicators:
9. Unit Economics
10. Growth Rate
11. Market Pull
```

### Decision Framework

**Question: "Do we have PMF?"**

**Check leading indicators first:**
- Organic growth? ✓
- Deep engagement? ✓
- Customer passion? ✓
- Sales velocity improving? ✓

**Hypothesis:** Likely have PMF

**Confirm with lagging indicators:**
- PMF score >40%? ✓
- Retention curves flat? ✓
- NPS >50? ✓
- LTV:CAC >3:1? ✓

**Conclusion:** Yes, have PMF, ready to scale

---

**Question: "Is PMF getting stronger or weaker?"**

**Leading indicators (current state):**
- Organic growth: Declining ✗
- Engagement: Flat ✗
- Passion: Less visible ✗

**Warning:** PMF may be weakening

**Lagging indicators (will confirm later):**
- PMF score: Still 45% (but check next quarter)
- Retention: Check for degradation
- NPS: Monitor closely

**Action:** Investigate immediately, don't wait for lagging metrics

---

### Early Warning System

**Set up alerts:**

**Leading indicator warnings (Act in days):**
- Organic growth declining 2 weeks straight
- Engagement metrics dropping
- Social mentions decreasing
- Sales cycles lengthening

**Lagging indicator warnings (Confirm trend):**
- PMF score declining >5% quarter over quarter
- Retention curves no longer flat
- NPS dropping
- Churn accelerating

**Response matrix:**
```
Leading declining + Lagging stable = Monitor closely, investigate
Leading declining + Lagging declining = Emergency, PMF at risk
Leading stable + Lagging declining = Data lag, likely real problem
Leading strong + Lagging strong = All good, maintain course
```

---

## Summary: Leading vs Lagging

**Use leading indicators to:**
- Feel PMF before metrics prove it
- Make fast decisions
- Course correct quickly
- Predict future metrics
- Act proactively

**Use lagging indicators to:**
- Confirm PMF definitively
- Benchmark against others
- Report to board/investors
- Validate strategy
- Make big decisions (scaling, fundraising)

**Best approach:**
Monitor both, act on leading, validate with lagging.

**The Golden Rule:**
If leading indicators look great but lagging indicators haven't caught up yet, be patient but watchful. If lagging indicators are great but leading indicators deteriorating, act immediately - PMF is at risk.
