# Product-Market Fit

Frameworks for measuring, achieving, and maintaining the critical milestone where your product satisfies strong market demand.

## Overview

Product-Market Fit (PMF) is the degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand - the inflection point where a product becomes a "must-have" for a well-defined market segment.

**Core Principle:** PMF is not a destination, it's a milestone that gives you permission to scale. Maintaining it requires continuous attention to customer needs and market evolution.

**Key Insight:** You can't manufacture PMF through marketing or sales tactics. PMF comes from deeply understanding a specific market segment and building something they desperately need. Scaling before PMF is the number one killer of startups.

**Historical Context:**
- Term coined by Marc Andreessen (2007)
- Operationalized by Sean Ellis with 40% rule (2010)
- Systematized by Rahul Vohra with Superhuman PMF Engine (2017)

## Measuring Product-Market Fit

### The Sean Ellis Test (40% Rule)

The definitive method for measuring PMF through a single powerful question.

**The Question:**
> "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
> - a) Very disappointed
> - b) Somewhat disappointed
> - c) Not disappointed (it isn't really that useful)

**PMF Threshold:**
- **40%+ "Very disappointed" = PMF achieved**
- 25-40% = Close, keep iterating
- <25% = No PMF yet

**Why this works:**
- Measures must-have vs. nice-to-have
- Predictive of retention
- Correlates with organic growth
- Simple to administer
- Actionable results

**Complete survey methodology:** See `assets/sean-ellis-pmf-survey.md` for:
- Full survey template
- When and how to administer
- Sample size requirements
- Analysis framework
- Segment breakdowns

### The Superhuman PMF Engine

Systematic framework for measuring and improving PMF score quarter over quarter.

**Philosophy:** PMF is not binary - it's a spectrum you can measure and improve systematically.

**The 5-Step Engine:**
1. **Segment users:** Very disappointed / Somewhat / Not disappointed
2. **Analyze champions:** Who are the "very disappointed" users? What do they have in common?
3. **Find your roadmap:** Different strategies for each segment
4. **Build strategically:** 50% for champions, 50% to convert warm users, 0% for wrong-fit
5. **Measure progress:** Re-survey quarterly, track improvement

**Superhuman's Results:**
```
Q1 2017: 22% â†’ Q2 2018: 58% (18 months)
```

**Complete framework:** See `assets/superhuman-pmf-engine.md` for:
- Detailed 5-step process
- Segment analysis worksheets
- Roadmap allocation strategy
- Progress tracking templates
- Prioritization frameworks

### Retention Curves: The Ultimate PMF Test

Retention patterns reveal if your product is truly a must-have.

**Three Patterns:**

**1. Leaky Bucket (No PMF):**
- Continuously declining curve
- Never flattens
- Users leave permanently
- Action: Find PMF before scaling

**2. Flattening Curve (PMF!):**
- Drops initially, then flattens at 30-50%
- Core users retain long-term
- Ready to scale
- Action: Prove acquisition channel, then scale

**3. Smiling Curve (Strong PMF):**
- Usage increases over time
- Network effects or habit formation
- Examples: Social networks, collaboration tools
- Action: Scale aggressively

**Complete analysis:** See `assets/retention-curve-analysis.md` for:

- Diagnosing problems
- Industry benchmarks
- Improving retention by phase

## Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

Use both types of indicators to measure PMF comprehensively.

### Leading Indicators (Feel It Now)

Early signals before metrics confirm PMF:

**1. Organic Growth:**
- Word-of-mouth referrals happening
- Unprompted social media mentions
- Inbound signup requests
- Target: >50% of growth organic

**2. User Engagement:**
- High DAU/MAU ratio (stickiness)
- Deep feature adoption
- Long session times
- Target: DAU/MAU >30-40% (B2B), >60% (B2C Social)

**3. Customer Passion:**
- "Don't take this away from me"
- Volunteering to help
- Unsolicited recommendations
- Active community forming

**4. Sales Velocity (B2B):**
- Deals closing faster over time
- Less price resistance
- Shorter sales cycles
- Higher win rates

**5. Struggle to Keep Up:**
- Natural waitlist forming
- Capacity challenges
- Can't hire fast enough
- Good problem to have

### Lagging Indicators (Metrics Confirm It)

Hard metrics that retrospectively validate PMF:

**1. Retention:**
- B2C: <5% monthly churn
- B2B: <2% logo churn
- Cohort curves flattening

**2. Net Promoter Score:**
- NPS >50 (world-class)
- High promoters, low detractors

**3. Unit Economics:**
- LTV:CAC >3:1 (minimum), >5:1 (ideal)
- Payback period <12 months
- Gross margin >70% (SaaS)

**4. Growth Rate:**
- Exponential not linear
- 10%+ month-over-month
- Compounding effects visible

**5. Market Pull:**
- Inbound >50% of new customers
- PR coverage without effort
- Competitive response
- Industry recognition

**Focus:**
- Prove one acquisition channel works
- Optimize unit economics
- Build for scalability
- Strengthen core value

**Green lights to scale:**
- LTV:CAC >3:1
- Retention curves flat/improving
- One repeatable channel working

### Post-PMF: Scaling (Years)

**Characteristics:**
- Predictable growth
- Multiple channels working
- Strong unit economics
- Efficient go-to-market

**Focus:**
