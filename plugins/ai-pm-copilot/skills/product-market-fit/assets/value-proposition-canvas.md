# Value Proposition Canvas

Framework for articulating your value proposition and testing if it creates product-market fit.

## The Classic Template

Geoffrey Moore's positioning statement format:

```
For [target customer segment]
Who [statement of need or opportunity]
Our [product name/category]
That [key benefit, compelling reason to buy]
Unlike [primary competitive alternative]
We [statement of primary differentiation]
```

## Worked Example: Superhuman

```
For busy executives and VCs
Who get 100+ emails per day and need to maintain "inbox zero"
Superhuman is an email client
That lets you process email 2x faster with keyboard shortcuts and AI triage
Unlike Gmail which is slow and cluttered
We provide blazing speed and focused workflow designed for power users
```

## Value Hypothesis Worksheet

### Part 1: Target Segment

**Who is this for?**

**Specific persona:**

- Role: **********\_**********
- Context: **********\_**********
- Characteristics: **********\_**********

**Examples of specificity:**

- ✗ Too broad: "Business professionals"
- ✓ Specific: "Series A-B startup founders juggling product, fundraising, and hiring"

**Why this segment?**

- Problem is most acute: **********\_**********
- Willing to pay: **********\_**********
- Reachable: **********\_**********
- Large enough: **********\_**********

**Size of segment:**

- TAM (Total): **\_** potential customers
- SAM (Serviceable): **\_** reachable customers
- SOM (Obtainable): **\_** realistically targetable in Year 1

---

### Part 2: Need/Problem

**What problem do they have?**

**Current situation:**

---

**Pain points:**

1. ***
2. ***
3. ***

**Severity:**

- [ ] Critical (business breaks without solution)
- [ ] High (significant pain, actively seeking solution)
- [ ] Medium (annoying but manageable)
- [ ] Low (nice to solve but not urgent)

**Frequency:**

- [ ] Daily
- [ ] Weekly
- [ ] Monthly
- [ ] Occasional

**PMF Insight:** High severity + High frequency = Strong PMF potential

---

**Jobs-to-be-Done framing:**

```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [expected outcome]
```

**Example:**

```
When I need to report project status to my CEO,
I want to quickly generate an accurate summary,
So I can look prepared and credible
```

---

### Part 3: Product Category

**What type of product is this?**

**Category:** **********\_**********

**Examples:**

- "Email client"
- "Project management tool"
- "Customer data platform"
- "Design collaboration tool"

**Why category matters:**

- Sets expectations
- Defines comparisons
- Shapes positioning

**Category choice:**

- [ ] Existing category (easier to explain, more competition)
- [ ] New category (harder to explain, potential leader)
- [ ] Reframe existing (challenge status quo)

**Elevator pitch test:**
"We're a [category] for [target segment]"

---

### Part 4: Key Benefit

**What's the main value you deliver?**

**The ONE thing:**

---

**Not features, but outcomes:**

- ✗ Feature: "We have advanced analytics"
- ✓ Outcome: "Make data-driven decisions in minutes, not hours"

**Examples of strong benefit statements:**

- "Process email 2x faster" (Superhuman)
- "Go from idea to launched site in an afternoon" (Webflow)
- "Collaborate on design in real-time" (Figma)
- "Never lose a customer request" (Linear)

**Quantified if possible:**

- 2x faster
- 10 hours saved per week
- 50% higher conversion
- Zero manual work

---

### Part 5: Competitive Alternative

**What do people use today?**

**Primary alternative:**

---

**Why alternative matters:**

- Shows you understand status quo
- Defines switching decision
- Clarifies differentiation

**Types of alternatives:**

1. **Direct competitors:** Other products in same category
2. **Indirect substitutes:** Different approach to same job
3. **DIY/Manual:** Spreadsheets, email, paper
4. **Do nothing:** Living with the pain

**Example alternatives:**

- Superhuman vs Gmail
- Figma vs Sketch + Abstract + InVision
- Notion vs Google Docs + Spreadsheets + Airtable
- Slack vs Email

**Most common alternative for target segment:**

---

---

### Part 6: Primary Differentiation

**Why choose you over the alternative?**

**Unique capability:**

---

**Types of differentiation:**

**1. Performance/Speed:**

- 10x faster
- Real-time vs batch
- Instant vs delayed

**2. Experience/Ease:**

- No learning curve
- Delightful vs functional
- Simple vs complex

**3. Completeness:**

- All-in-one vs stitched together
- Integrated vs fragmented

**4. Specialization:**

- Built for X vs generic
- Deep vs shallow
- Expert vs generalist

**5. Business Model:**

- Self-serve vs sales-led
- Affordable vs expensive
- Transparent vs opaque

**Your differentiation:**

- Type: **********\_**********
- Defensible? [ ] Yes [ ] No
- Matters to target segment? [ ] Yes [ ] No

---

## Testing Your Value Proposition

### The "Very Disappointed" Test

**Ask potential customers:**

> "How would you feel if you could no longer use [this solution]?"

**Target:** 40%+ say "Very disappointed"

**If describing hypothetical product, ask:**

> "How would you feel if this product didn't exist and you couldn't get it?"

---

### The Painkiller vs Vitamin Test

**Painkiller:**

- Solves urgent, painful problem
- Users actively seeking solution
- Willing to pay premium
- High switching motivation

**Vitamin:**

- Nice to have improvement
- Users not actively seeking
- Low willingness to pay
- Low switching motivation

**Your product:**

- [ ] Painkiller (Strong PMF potential)
- [ ] Vitamin (Weak PMF potential)

**If vitamin, reconsider value prop or target segment**

---

### The Competitor Reaction Test

**Would competitors care if you succeed?**

- [ ] Would copy you (validates differentiation matters)
- [ ] Would ignore you (maybe not differentiated enough)
- [ ] Would panic (very strong differentiation)

**If they'd ignore you:** Differentiation may not be compelling

---

### The Investor/Friend Pitch Test

**Can you explain value prop in one sentence?**

"We're [product] that helps [segment] [key benefit] unlike [alternative] by [differentiation]"

**Example:**
"We're an email client that helps busy executives process email 2x faster unlike Gmail by providing keyboard shortcuts and AI triage"

**Test:**

- Do they immediately understand?
- Do they ask good questions?
- Do they say "I need that"?
- Or do they look confused?

---

## Common Value Prop Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Broad

**Bad:** "Project management for teams"

- Everyone does project management
- Teams could mean anything
- No differentiation

**Good:** "Project management for design teams tracking creative sprints"

- Specific segment
- Specific use case
- Specific differentiation

---

### Mistake 2: Feature-Led

**Bad:** "We have AI and blockchain"

- Technology, not benefit
- Means nothing to user
- Sounds like buzzword bingo

**Good:** "Make data-driven decisions in seconds without technical skills"

- Outcome-focused
- Benefit clear
- Technology invisible

---

### Mistake 3: "Better" Without Context

**Bad:** "Faster, better, easier project management"

- Better than what?
- How much faster?
- Vague claims

**Good:** "2x faster than Asana for engineering teams, with GitHub integration"

- Quantified (2x)
- Compared to specific alternative
- Clear differentiation (GitHub integration)

---

### Mistake 4: Everything to Everyone

**Bad:** "For freelancers, SMBs, enterprises, and agencies"

- No focus
- Different needs
- Diluted value prop

**Good:** "For freelance designers managing 5-10 client projects"

- Specific segment
- Specific scale
- Specific context

---

### Mistake 5: Differentiation on Table Stakes

**Bad:** "Unlike competitors, we have mobile apps"

- Everyone has mobile apps
- Not actually differentiated
- Table stakes feature

**Good:** "Unlike competitors, we work fully offline with conflict-free sync"

- Rare capability
- Meaningful difference
- Solves specific problem

---

## Value Prop Evolution

### Pre-PMF: Narrow and Deep

**Start hyper-focused:**

- Very specific segment
- Very specific problem
- Very specific solution

**Example:**
"Email for VCs and execs with 100+ emails/day"

**Why:**

- Easier to get first customers
- Clearer what to build
- Faster to PMF

---

### At PMF: Maintain Focus

**Don't expand too fast:**

- Serve core segment exceptionally
- Strengthen differentiation
- Resist "we should add..."

**Example:**
"Email for busy professionals who need inbox zero"
(Slightly broader, but still focused)

---

### Post-PMF: Strategic Expansion

**Expand thoughtfully:**

- Adjacent segments (similar needs)
- New use cases (same segment)
- Geographic expansion (same value prop)

**Example:**
"Email for anyone who wants to get through email 2x faster"
(Much broader, but maintained core benefit)

**Risk:**
Lose focus and dilute value prop for original champions

## Validation Checklist

Use this to test if your value prop will drive PMF:

- [ ] Target segment is specific and reachable
- [ ] Problem is urgent and frequent (painkiller)
- [ ] Category is clear and understood
- [ ] Benefit is quantified and meaningful
- [ ] Alternative is well-understood
- [ ] Differentiation is defensible and matters
