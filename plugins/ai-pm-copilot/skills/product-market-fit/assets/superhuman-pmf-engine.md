# Superhuman PMF Engine Worksheet

Systematic framework for measuring and improving product-market fit, based on Rahul Vohra's methodology that took Superhuman from 22% to 58% PMF score.

## Philosophy

**Core Belief:** PMF is not binary (yes/no), it's a spectrum you can measure and improve systematically through data-driven iteration.

**The Breakthrough:** Don't just measure PMF - build a repeatable engine to improve it quarter over quarter.

## The 5-Step Engine

### Step 1: Segment Your Users

Run the Sean Ellis PMF survey and divide respondents into three segments:

**Segment A: "Very disappointed" users**

- Your champions
- Target users
- Product is a must-have for them

**Segment B: "Somewhat disappointed" users**

- On the fence
- Could become champions
- Or might be wrong segment

**Segment C: "Not disappointed" users**

- Product isn't valuable to them
- Likely wrong segment
- Or didn't reach core value

**Worksheet:**

```
Total Responses: _____

Segment A: _____ (____%)  "Very disappointed"
Segment B: _____ (____%)  "Somewhat disappointed"
Segment C: _____ (____%)  "Not disappointed"

Current PMF Score: _____%
Target PMF Score: 40%+
Gap: _____%
```

---

### Step 2: Analyze High-Expectation Customers

Deep dive into your "very disappointed" users to understand what makes them champions.

**Key Questions:**

**Who are they?**

- Roles: **********\_**********
- Company types: **********\_**********
- Use cases: **********\_**********
- Demographics: **********\_**********

**What do they have in common?**

- Similar behaviors: **********\_**********
- Similar contexts: **********\_**********
- Similar goals: **********\_**********

**Why do they love it?**
(From Q5: "What is the main benefit you receive from [Product]?")

Common themes:

1. ***
2. ***
3. ***

**Quotes from champions:**

- "**********\_**********"
- "**********\_**********"
- "**********\_**********"

**What makes it a must-have for them?**

- Core value: **********\_**********
- Alternatives they've tried: **********\_**********
- Why you're better: **********\_**********

---

### Step 3: Find Your Product/Market Fit Roadmap

Analyze the three segments using responses from Q5-Q7.

#### For Segment A (Very Disappointed)

**Q5: Main benefit they receive**

Theme analysis:

- Most common benefit: **********\_**********
- Second most common: **********\_**********
- Third most common: **********\_**********

**Action:** Double down on these benefits. Make them even stronger.

**Q7: How can we improve?**

Top requests:

1. **********\_********** (mentioned \_\_ times)
2. **********\_********** (mentioned \_\_ times)
3. **********\_********** (mentioned \_\_ times)

**Action:** Build these features - your champions want them.

---

#### For Segment B (Somewhat Disappointed)

**First, filter by target persona:**

**Q6: What type of people would benefit most?**

- Do they describe your ICP? [ ] Yes [ ] No

**If YES (they match ICP):**

What's missing for them?

**Q5: Main benefit**

- Are they getting different value than Segment A? **********\_**********
- Is core value resonating? **********\_**********

**Q7: Improvements they want**

Gaps preventing "very disappointed":

1. ***
2. ***
3. ***

**Action:** Address these gaps to convert them to champions.

**If NO (they don't match ICP):**

Why are they here?

- Wrong use case: **********\_**********
- Different persona: **********\_**********
- Mis-targeted marketing: **********\_**********

**Action:** Don't build for them. Focus on champions instead.

---

#### For Segment C (Not Disappointed)

**Why aren't they disappointed?**

**Q5: What benefit do they receive?**

- Are they getting any value? **********\_**********
- Is it peripheral value, not core? **********\_**********

**Q6: Who would benefit most?**

- Do they describe themselves? **********\_**********
- Do they describe someone else? **********\_**********

**Analysis:**

- [ ] Wrong segment entirely
- [ ] Didn't reach core value (onboarding issue)
- [ ] Expecting something we don't offer
- [ ] Trying to use product wrong way

**Action:**

- If wrong segment: Ignore, don't build for them
- If onboarding issue: Fix activation flow
- If mismatched expectations: Improve positioning/messaging

---

### Step 4: Build Your Roadmap

Allocate your roadmap between strengthening core and converting warm users.

#### The 50/50 Rule

**50% of roadmap: Delight champions (Segment A)**

- Build features they requested (Q7)
- Strengthen core benefits they value (Q5)
- Make must-have even more must-have

**Example features:**

1. **********\_********** (requested by \_\_ champions)
2. **********\_********** (strengthens core benefit: ****\_\_\_\_****)
3. **********\_********** (requested by \_\_ champions)

**50% of roadmap: Convert warm prospects (Segment B who match ICP)**

- Address gaps they identified (Q7)
- Add value that would make them champions
- Remove friction preventing full value

**Example features:**

1. **********\_********** (gap for Segment B: ****\_\_\_\_****)
2. **********\_********** (converts "somewhat" to "very")
3. **********\_********** (addresses barrier: ****\_\_\_\_****)

**0% of roadmap: Don't build for Segment C**

- Unless it's an onboarding fix
- Unless it's clarifying positioning
- Don't add features just for them

---

#### Prioritization Framework

For each potential feature:

```
Feature: _____________________

Who wants it?
[ ] Segment A (champions) - High priority
[ ] Segment B (convertible) - Medium priority
[ ] Segment C (wrong segment) - Low/No priority

How many requested it?
_____ people (____% of segment)

What problem does it solve?
_____________________

Impact if built:
[ ] Strengthens core value (do it)
[ ] Removes friction (do it)
[ ] New capability (maybe)
[ ] Nice-to-have (probably not)

Effort:
[ ] Small (weeks)
[ ] Medium (month)
[ ] Large (quarter+)

Priority Score: _____
```

### Step 5: Measure Progress

Implement quarterly measurement cycle to track PMF improvement.

#### Measurement Cadence

**Quarterly survey schedule:**

- Q1: **\_** (target date)
- Q2: **\_** (target date)
- Q3: **\_** (target date)
- Q4: **\_** (target date)

**Between surveys:**

- Monitor proxy metrics (retention, engagement, NPS)
- Interview users from each segment
- Track feature adoption
- Measure impact of releases

---

#### Progress Tracking

**PMF Score Trend:**

```
Quarter | Score | Change | Actions Taken
--------|-------|--------|---------------
Q_____  | ___% |   -    | Baseline
Q_____  | ___% | +/- __% | _______________
Q_____  | ___% | +/- __% | _______________
Q_____  | ___% | +/- __% | _______________
```

**What worked:**

- ***
- ***
- ***

**What didn't:**

- ***
- ***
- ***

**Next quarter focus:**

- ***
- ***
- ***

---

#### Segment Evolution

Track how segments change over time:

```
Segment    | Q___ | Q___ | Q___ | Q___ | Goal
-----------|------|------|------|------|------
Very (A)   | __% | __% | __% | __% | 40%+
Somewhat(B)| __% | __% | __% | __% | 30%
Not (C)    | __% | __% | __% | __% | 20%
```

**Ideal trend:**

- Segment A growing (champions increasing)
- Segment B stable or shrinking (converting to A)
- Segment C shrinking (better targeting, onboarding)

**Warning signs:**

- Segment A shrinking (losing champions!)
- Segment C growing (wrong users signing up)
- No movement quarter over quarter (roadmap not working)

## The Superhuman Example

### Their Journey

**Q1 2017: 22% PMF Score**

- Initial measurement
- Below PMF threshold
- Need systematic improvement

**Segment Analysis:**

- Champions: VCs, execs, founders with 100+ emails/day
- Not their users: Casual email users

**Roadmap Split:**

- 50%: Make it faster, better keyboard shortcuts, more integrations (for champions)
- 50%: Better onboarding, clearer value prop (to convert warm users)

**Q2 2017: 33%** (+11%)

- Improved speed
- Added keyboard shortcuts
- Champions even happier

**Q3 2017: 40%** (+7%)

- PMF achieved!
- But continued improving

**Q4 2017: 48%** (+8%)

- Strengthened core further
- Converted more warm users

**Q2 2018: 58%** (+10%)

- World-class PMF
- Ready to scale aggressively
- Raised $33M Series B

**Key Lessons:**

1. Systematic beats intuition
2. Focus on champions (high-expectation customers)
3. Measure religiously
4. 18 months to go from 22% to 58%

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Building for everyone**

- Trying to please all three segments
- Dilutes product
- Champions become less happy
- **Fix:** Focus on Segment A, convert Segment B (if ICP match), ignore Segment C

**Mistake 2: Ignoring qualitative data**

- Only looking at PMF score number
- Missing the "why"
- Not reading Q5-Q7 responses
- **Fix:** Read every response, find patterns, quote users in roadmap discussions

**Mistake 3: Impatient iteration**

- Expecting PMF score to jump quickly
- Pivoting roadmap every month
- Not giving changes time to work
- **Fix:** Quarterly cadence, stick to plan, compound improvements

**Mistake 4: Not segmenting**

- Lumping all users together
- Missing that you have PMF with one segment
- Building for wrong segment
- **Fix:** Always analyze by segment, know your champions

**Mistake 5: Stopping after 40%**

- Assuming PMF is done
- No longer measuring
- PMF degrades over time
- **Fix:** Continuous measurement, never stop improving
