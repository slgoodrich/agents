## NFR Checklist

When documenting NFRs, ensure:

- [ ] **Specific and Measurable** - No vague terms like "fast" or "secure"
- [ ] **Testable** - Can verify if requirement is met
- [ ] **Realistic** - Achievable with available resources
- [ ] **Prioritized** - Critical, High, Medium, Low
- [ ] **Includes Metrics** - Numbers, percentages, time periods
- [ ] **Context Provided** - Under what conditions measured
- [ ] **Verification Method** - How to test/validate
- [ ] **Rationale** - Why this requirement exists
- [ ] **Trade-offs Acknowledged** - What you're optimizing for

---

## Common NFR Mistakes

### ❌ Too Vague

**Bad:** "System should be fast"

**Good:** "Dashboard loads in <2 seconds (p95) for 10,000 concurrent users"

---

### ❌ Not Measurable

**Bad:** "System should be highly available"

**Good:** "System maintains 99.9% uptime (max 8.7 hours downtime/year)"

---

### ❌ Missing Context

**Bad:** "API response time <100ms"

**Good:** "API GET requests return in <100ms (p95) measured from application server, excluding network latency, with database containing 1M records"

---

### ❌ No Verification Method

**Bad:** "System must be secure"

**Good:** "System passes OWASP Top 10 security scan with zero high/critical findings, verified monthly via automated scanning"
