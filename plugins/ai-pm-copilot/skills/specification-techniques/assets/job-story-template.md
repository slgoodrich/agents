## Job Story Format

## Job Story vs User Story

**User Story (Persona-Based):**

## Job Story Patterns

### Pattern 1: Information Seeking

```
When [I need information in a specific context]

---

So I can [save time for other priorities]
```

**Use for:** Shortcuts, automation, bulk actions

---

### Pattern 3: Confidence/Anxiety Reduction

When [I'm uncertain about a decision or action]
I want to [get confirmation, see preview, understand impact]
So I can [proceed confidently without fear of mistakes]
```

**Use for:** Previews, undo, confirmation dialogs, help text

---

## Converting User Stories to Job Stories

### Example Conversion

**User Story:**

```
As a project manager
I want to assign tasks to team members
So that everyone knows their responsibilities
```

**Job Story (Better):**

```
When I'm planning work for the sprint and need to delegate
I want to assign specific tasks to team members with clear deadlines
So I can ensure everyone knows what to work on and nothing falls through the cracks
```

**Why Better:**

- Captures the context (sprint planning, delegation)
- Reveals motivation (prevent work from being forgotten)
- Not tied to "project manager" role (anyone delegating work has this need)

## Job Story Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific About Context

**Vague:** "When I want to share content"

**Specific:** "When I find an article relevant to an ongoing team discussion"

---

### 2. Focus on Motivation, Not Solution

**Solution-Focused (Bad):** "I want a share button"

**Motivation-Focused (Good):** "I want to quickly get this article to my team"

---

### 3. Describe Observable Outcomes

**Vague:** "So I can be more productive"

**Observable:** "So I can complete the report before the 2pm meeting"

---

### 4. Avoid Assuming Personas

**Persona-Dependent:** "When I, as a power user..."

**Context-Dependent:** "When I'm managing 50+ projects..."

---

### 5. Capture Real Situations

**Made-Up:** "When I want better organization"

**Real:** "When my inbox has 200 unread messages and I can't find the important one from my boss"

---

## Job Story Validation

### Test Your Job Story

**Good Job Stories Have:**

- [x] Specific situation described
- [x] Clear motivation stated
- [x] Measurable outcome defined
- [x] Not tied to a specific solution
- [x] Based on real user research
- [x] Reveals underlying need

**Red Flags:**

- [ ] Could apply to anyone in any situation (too generic)
- [ ] Describes a feature instead of a need
- [ ] Uses persona instead of situation
- [ ] Made up without user research
- [ ] Outcome is not measurable

---

### Example Validation

**Job Story:**

```
When I'm in a meeting and need to reference previous discussions
I want to quickly search message history by keyword
So I can find relevant context without disrupting the meeting flow
```

**Validation:**

- [x] Specific situation: "in a meeting", "need to reference previous discussions"
- [x] Clear motivation: "quickly search" (time pressure is clear)
- [x] Measurable outcome: "find context without disrupting flow"
- [x] Not solution-specific: Doesn't prescribe how search works
- [x] Based on research: Common pain point from user interviews
- [x] Reveals need: Real-time information retrieval under time pressure

**This is a good job story ✓**

## When to Use Job Stories vs User Stories

**Use Job Stories When:**

- Discovering new product ideas
- Understanding underlying needs
- Designing for diverse user base
- Context matters more than persona
- Exploring "why" behind feature requests

**Use User Stories When:**

- Implementing known features
- Working with established personas
- Team prefers user story format
- Need simpler format for sprint planning
- Building persona-specific features

**Use Both:**

- Job stories for discovery and requirement definition
- User stories for implementation and sprint planning
