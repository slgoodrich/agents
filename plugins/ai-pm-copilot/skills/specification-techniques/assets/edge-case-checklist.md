# Edge Case and Error Handling Checklist

Comprehensive checklist for systematic edge case coverage and error handling in specifications.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

For every feature or user story, go through each category and identify which edge cases apply. Document how the system should handle each case.

**Format for each edge case:**
```
Scenario: [What happens]
Expected Behavior: [How system should respond]
User Experience: [What user sees/experiences]
System Behavior: [What happens behind the scenes]
```

## Error Handling Template

For each edge case identified, document using this format:

```markdown
### Edge Case: [Name]

**Scenario:**
[Describe what happens]

**Frequency:** [How often this occurs: Common / Occasional / Rare]

**Impact:** [Critical / High / Medium / Low]

**Expected System Behavior:**
1. [What system does internally]
2. [How it logs/monitors]
3. [Whether it retries]

**User Experience:**
- **Error Message:** "[Exact error message shown]"
- **UI State:** [What happens to UI - disable buttons, show error, etc.]
- **Recovery Action:** [What user can do to fix/retry]

**Example:**

Scenario: User submits form with invalid email format
Expected System Behavior:
1. System validates email format client-side before submission
2. System displays inline error on email field
3. System prevents form submission until corrected

User Experience:
- **Error Message:** "Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@example.com)"
- **UI State:** Email field highlighted in red, error message below field, submit button remains enabled
- **Recovery Action:** User corrects email and resubmits
```

## Prioritization Framework

Not all edge cases are equal. Prioritize coverage using this framework:

### Must Handle (P0)

- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss scenarios
- Payment failures
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Scenarios causing crashes/errors

### Should Handle (P1)

- Common user mistakes
- Network issues
- Browser compatibility
- Mobile-specific issues
- Accessibility concerns

### Nice to Handle (P2)

- Rare edge cases with low impact
- Cosmetic issues
- Advanced browser features
- Obscure device configurations

---

## Testing Checklist

For each edge case documented:

- [ ] Unit test exists
- [ ] Integration test exists
- [ ] Manual test case documented
- [ ] Error message is user-friendly
- [ ] Error is logged for debugging
- [ ] Metrics track frequency
- [ ] User can recover without data loss

---

## Review Questions

Before considering edge case coverage complete, answer:

1. What happens if this field is empty?
2. What happens if this value is negative?
3. What happens if the user loses internet connection right now?
4. What happens if two users do this at the same time?
5. What happens if this external service is down?
6. What happens if the user hits back button?
7. What happens if the user's permission changes mid-operation?
8. What happens at midnight/month boundary/year boundary?
9. What happens if someone intentionally tries to break this?
10. What happens if this takes 10x longer than expected?
