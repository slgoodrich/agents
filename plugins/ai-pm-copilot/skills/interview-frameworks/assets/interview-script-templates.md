# Interview Script Templates

## Overview

Ready-to-use interview scripts for different research scenarios. Each template includes timing, questions, and guidance for conducting effective user interviews.

---

## Four Interview Types

Choose the right script based on your research goal:

**Discovery Interviews** → Understand problems and needs
**Validation Interviews** → Test solutions and concepts
**Usability Interviews** → Test actual product
**Generative Interviews** → Broad exploration without hypothesis

---

## 1. Discovery Interview Script (Problem Exploration)

### Purpose
Understand problems, needs, contexts, and pain points

### When to Use
- Early product development
- Exploring new market
- Problem validation
- Understanding workflows

### Interview Structure (30 minutes total)

---

### Opening (5 minutes)

**1. Introduction**
```
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking time to chat with me. I'm researching [topic] to understand how [target users] currently [task/workflow].

The goal is to learn from your experience - there are no right or wrong answers. I'm just here to listen and understand."
```

**2. Set Expectations**
```
"This will take about 30 minutes. I'll ask about [specific topic], your workflows, and any challenges you face.

Most important: I want to hear about your real experiences. Don't worry about being polite or positive - honest feedback, including frustrations, is most valuable."
```

**3. Request Permission to Record**
```
"Do you mind if I record this conversation for my notes? Only our team will see it, and it helps me focus on listening rather than writing everything down."

[If yes: Start recording]
[If no: No problem, proceed with note-taking]
```

**4. Build Rapport**
```
"Before we dive in, tell me a bit about your role and what you do day-to-day..."

[Let them talk for 1-2 minutes]
[This helps them relax and provides context]
```

   [Quantify investment in problem area]
```

**Follow-up probes**:
- "Can you walk me through how you do that?"
- "What happens before/after that step?"
- "Who else is involved in that process?"

---

### Problem Questions (10 minutes)

## Interview Tips for All Types

### Pacing
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Allow silence (count to 5 before filling)
- One question at a time
- Don't rush to next question

### Active Listening
- Nod and maintain eye contact
- Take notes but don't look down entire time
- "Mm-hmm" and "tell me more" to encourage
- Paraphrase to confirm understanding

### Body Language
- Open posture (no crossed arms)
- Lean slightly forward (shows interest)
- Mirror their energy (if excited, be engaged; if reserved, be calm)

### When Things Go Wrong

**They give one-word answers**:
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "Walk me through an example"
- "Help me understand - what do you mean by that?"

**They're pitching you**:
- "I appreciate that, but right now I'm focused on learning from your experience"
- "Let's put that aside for now - I want to hear about your challenges first"

**They ask what you think**:
- "I'm curious what you think first"
- "There's no right answer - just want your perspective"

**They're clearly lying to be polite**:
- "I'm sensing some hesitation - tell me honestly, what concerns you?"
- "It's really helpful to hear the bad stuff - that's what helps us improve"

## Next Steps

1. Choose the script that matches your research goal
2. Adapt questions to your specific context
3. Practice with a colleague (run through at least once)
4. Conduct 5+ interviews before drawing conclusions
5. Review recordings and notes after each interview
6. Synthesize findings across interviews
