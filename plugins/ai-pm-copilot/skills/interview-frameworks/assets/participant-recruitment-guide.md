## Overview

How to find, screen, and recruit the right participants for user research interviews. Includes screener templates, sourcing strategies, outreach templates, and incentive guidance.

---

## Step 1: Define Your Target Participants

### Creating Recruitment Criteria

**Must-Have Criteria** (Disqualify if they don't meet these):

These are non-negotiable. Anyone who doesn't meet ALL must-haves is disqualified.

**Example: B2B SaaS Product Research**:
```
Must-Have:
- Role: Product Manager, Product Owner, or similar
- Company size: 10-500 employees
- Currently uses project management software
- Has been in role for 6+ months
- Decision maker or influencer for tool purchases
```

**Nice-to-Have Criteria** (Useful for diversity):

These add variety but aren't required.

**Example**:
```
Nice-to-Have:
- Mix of industries (SaaS, E-commerce, Fintech, Healthcare)
- Mix of geographies (US, Europe, Asia)
- Mix of experience levels (1-3 years, 3-5 years, 5+ years)
- Gender diversity
- Company growth stage (early startup, growth, mature)
```

**Disqualify Criteria** (Automatically exclude):

```
Disqualify:
- Works at direct competitor
- Close friend or family member (too biased)
- Professional research participant (does 10+ studies/year)
- Previously interviewed in last 6 months
- Works at your company
```

### Participant Segmentation

**Why segment**: Different users have different needs. Interview across segments to get complete picture.

**Common Segmentation Dimensions**:

**By Behavior**:
- Power users vs. casual users
- Daily users vs. weekly users
- Early adopters vs. late majority

**By Demographics**:
- Company size: SMB (10-50), Mid-market (50-500), Enterprise (500+)
- Role: Individual contributor vs. manager vs. executive
- Industry: Vertical-specific needs

**By Need**:
- High pain (desperate for solution)
- Medium pain (looking but not urgent)
- Low pain (satisfied with status quo)

**Example: PM Tool Research**
```
Segment 1: Solo PMs at startups (10-50 employees)
Segment 2: PM teams at mid-market (50-500 employees)
Segment 3: Enterprise PMs (500+ employees)

Goal: 5 interviews per segment = 15 total
```

○ I approve and make final decisions
○ I research options and make recommendations

- Market (Bay Area = more than elsewhere)

---

**Early Access**:
- Pros: Free, attracts early adopters, builds community

- Best for: Beta testing, loyal users

---

### When to Pay

**After the interview** (Recommended):
- Reduces no-shows
- Only pay those who show up
- Standard practice

**Example**:
```

## Step 6: Scheduling

### Booking Tools

**Setup**:
```
1. Create "User Interview" event type

4. Connect Zoom/Meet for auto video links
5. Add confirmation email with:
