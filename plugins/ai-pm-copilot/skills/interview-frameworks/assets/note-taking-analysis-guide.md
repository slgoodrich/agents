## Part 1: Recording Interviews

### Should You Record?

**YES - Record whenever possible**

**Benefits**:

- Don't miss critical details
- Review later for quotes and nuances
- Share with team who couldn't attend
- Create highlight reels for the team
- Focus on listening, not frantic note-taking
- Catch tone, emotion, body language (video)

**Downsides**:

- Some participants uncomfortable
- Transcription isn't perfect (AI makes mistakes)
- Can rely on it too much (less present during interview)
- Privacy concerns
- Time to review (30-min interview = 30 min to review)

---

### How to Ask Permission

**Always ask, never assume**:

```
"Do you mind if I record this conversation for my notes? Only our team will see it, and it helps me focus on our conversation rather than writing everything down."

[Pause - let them answer]

Alternative phrasing:
"Is it OK if I record so I can give you my full attention?"
"Would you be comfortable if I recorded this? Makes it easier for me to remember details."
```

**If they say no**:

```
"No problem at all. I'll just take notes as we talk."

[Don't push or make them uncomfortable]
[Take thorough notes instead]
```

**If they say yes**:

```
"Thank you! Starting the recording now."

[Click record]
[Verbally confirm: "Recording started"]
```

- [ ] Ensure sufficient storage/cloud space
- [ ] Know how to pause/stop recording

**During interview**:

- [ ] Start recording at beginning (after permission)
- [ ] Verbally note recording started
- [ ] Periodically check it's still recording
- [ ] Don't stop recording until after goodbye

**After interview**:

- [ ] Save recording with clear naming: `[Date]_[Participant-Name]_[Topic].mp4`
- [ ] Back up to cloud storage
- [ ] Generate transcript if using AI tool
- [ ] Add to research repository

## Part 2: Note-Taking During Interviews

### Why Take Notes Even If Recording

**Recordings are backup, notes are primary**:

- Faster to scan notes than re-watch recording
- Highlights key moments in real-time
- Captures your immediate observations
- Some participants decline recording
- Recording can fail (tech issues)

---

### Two-Column Note-Taking Framework

**Purpose**: Separate facts from interpretations

**Left Column: Observations** (What they said/did)
**Right Column: Interpretations/Questions** (What you think it means)

**Example**:

| Observations (Facts)                      | Interpretations / Questions                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| "We use spreadsheets for projects"        | Pain: Manual, error-prone?                     |
| "Takes me 2 hours every Monday"           | Severity: HIGH (2hr/week = ~100hr/year)        |
| "My boss always asks for status"          | Job: Upward reporting visibility               |
| [Frustrated sigh when mentioning process] | Emotion: Strong frustration                    |
| "I tried Asana but team didn't adopt it"  | Adoption failure - why? Training? Too complex? |
| "47 times last month"                     | Specific data - problem is frequent            |

**Benefits**:

- Facts are searchable, quotable
- Interpretations stay separate (you might be wrong)
- Easy to scan for patterns
- Captures both data and hypotheses

---

### What to Capture

**Direct quotes** (verbatim):

```
Use quotation marks

Capture:
- Vivid descriptions: "It's like herding cats"
- Strong emotions: "That drives me absolutely crazy"
- Specific pain points: "I waste 2 hours every week on this"
- Surprising insights: "I never thought of it that way"
- Exact numbers: "47 times last month"

Don't capture every word - just impactful quotes
```

**Behaviors and body language**:

```
Use [brackets]

Capture:
- [Long pause before answering]
- [Leaned back, crossed arms]
- [Lit up when mentioning X]
- [Frustrated sigh]
- [Struggled to find words]
- [Immediately said yes vs. hesitated]
```

**Your observations**:

```
Use parentheses or separate column

Capture:
- (This contradicts what they said earlier)
- (Seems more excited about X than Y)
- (Follow up on this point)
- (Similar to what Participant 3 said)
```

---

### Note-Taking Template

**Pre-fill before interview**:

```

## Part 3: Synthesis and Analysis

### Process Overview

```
1. Individual Interview Notes (During)
   ↓
2. Immediate Debrief (Right after)
   ↓
3. Transcription Review (Within 24 hours)
   ↓
4. Observation Extraction (After 3-5 interviews)
   ↓
5. Affinity Mapping (After all interviews)
   ↓
6. Insight Generation (Cross-interview patterns)
   ↓
7. Reporting (Share with the team)
```

---

### Step 1: Immediate Debrief

**Do this right after every interview** (5-10 minutes):

**Questions to answer**:

```
1. What stood out most?
   [Top 3 things that surprised or struck you]

2. Key quotes to remember?
   [Most powerful verbatim quotes]

3. How does this compare to previous interviews?
   [Patterns emerging? Contradictions?]

4. What should I ask next participants about?
   [Questions this interview surfaced]

5. Hypothesis changes?
   [What did I learn that challenges my assumptions?]
```

**Why do this immediately**:

- Fresh memory (details fade fast)
- Capture gut reactions
- Notice patterns early
- Adjust interview guide for next interviews

---

### Step 2: Transcription Review

**Within 24 hours of interview**:

1. Read/skim transcript
2. Highlight key sections
3. Add timestamps for important moments
4. Extract best quotes
5. Note contradictions or surprises
6. Link to notes from other interviews

**Transcript cleaning**:

```
AI transcription mistakes to fix:
- "Their/there/they're" errors
- Proper nouns (company names, product names)
- Industry jargon and acronyms
- Numbers (forty-seven → 47)
- [Unintelligible] sections - re-listen if important
```

---

### Step 3: Observation Extraction

**After 3-5 interviews**, extract observations:

**Create observation database**:

| Observation                        | Participant    | Type    | Frequency | Impact    |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| "Spreadsheets error-prone"         | P1, P2, P4     | Pain    | High      | High      |
| "Boss asks for status weekly"      | P1, P2, P3, P5 | Need    | Very High | Medium    |
| "Tried Asana, didn't stick"        | P2, P4         | Context | Medium    | Low       |
| "Waste 2+ hours/week on reporting" | P1, P3, P4     | Pain    | High      | Very High |

**Types of observations**:

- **Pain**: Problems, frustrations
- **Need**: Jobs to be done, desired outcomes
- **Behavior**: What they actually do
- **Context**: Environment, constraints
- **Emotion**: How they feel
- **Quote**: Memorable verbatim

---

### Step 4: Affinity Mapping

**Purpose**: Find patterns across all interviews

**Process**:

**1. Write observations on sticky notes** (one per note)

```
Physical: Post-it notes
Digital: Miro, Mural, FigJam, Dovetail

Examples:
- "User mentioned spreadsheets error-prone" - P1
- "Takes 2 hours per week to update status" - P3
- "Boss requires weekly status report" - P2
- "Team missed deadline due to lack of visibility" - P4
- "Excel file corrupt, lost week of data" - P1
- "Tried Asana but too complex for team" - P4
```

**2. Put all notes on wall/board** (No grouping yet)

```
Don't organize yet - just get all observations visible
```

**3. Group similar notes together** (Silently at first)

```
Move notes around
Group by similarity
Don't name groups yet
Let patterns emerge naturally

Example groups forming:
- Notes about manual work
- Notes about reporting to management
- Notes about team coordination
- Notes about tools that failed
```

**4. Name each cluster** (Theme)

```
Once groups are stable, name them:

Cluster 1: "Manual status reporting pain"
Cluster 2: "Need for management visibility"
Cluster 3: "Team coordination challenges"
Cluster 4: "Tool adoption failures"
```

**5. Look for relationships between clusters** (Higher-level insights)

```
Connections:
- "Manual reporting" driven by "Need for visibility"
- "Coordination challenges" lead to "Adoption failures"

Meta-insight:
"Managers demand visibility → Forces manual reporting → Team burns out"

Opportunity:
"Automate status reporting → Reduce manual work → Increase visibility"
```

---

### Affinity Mapping Example

**Research topic**: Project management for product teams

**Observations** (20 sticky notes):

```
"Spend 2hr/week on status reports" (P1)
"Boss asks for project status every week" (P2)
"Use spreadsheets to track tasks" (P1)
"Excel file corrupted, lost data" (P3)
"Team works in different tools" (P4)
"Hard to know what everyone's working on" (P2)
"Tried Asana, too complicated" (P4)
"Tried Trello, too simple" (P3)
"Copy-paste from Jira into slides" (P1)
"Status updates always out of date" (P5)
"Waste time in status meetings" (P2)
"No central source of truth" (P4)
"Email updates get buried" (P3)
"Can't see dependencies" (P5)
"Missing deadlines, don't know why" (P2)
"Onboarding new PM takes weeks" (P4)
"Each PM does things differently" (P3)
"No visibility into workload" (P1)
"Can't prioritize without seeing all work" (P5)
"Tools don't talk to each other" (P2)
```

**Grouped into themes**:

**Theme 1: "Manual reporting overhead"**

```
- "Spend 2hr/week on status reports"
- "Copy-paste from Jira into slides"
- "Status updates always out of date"
- "Waste time in status meetings"
```

→ **Insight**: Reporting is manual, time-consuming, always stale

**Theme 2: "Management visibility needs"**

```
- "Boss asks for project status every week"
- "No central source of truth"
- "Can't see dependencies"
- "No visibility into workload"
```

→ **Insight**: Managers need real-time visibility, lack it today

**Theme 3: "Tool fragmentation"**

```
- "Team works in different tools"
- "Tools don't talk to each other"
- "Email updates get buried"
- "No central source of truth"
```

→ **Insight**: Scattered tools create information silos

**Theme 4: "Coordination failures"**

```
- "Hard to know what everyone's working on"
- "Missing deadlines, don't know why"
- "Can't prioritize without seeing all work"
- "Each PM does things differently"
```

→ **Insight**: Lack of coordination causing missed deadlines

**Theme 5: "Tool adoption challenges"**

```
- "Tried Asana, too complicated"
- "Tried Trello, too simple"
- "Onboarding new PM takes weeks"
- "Use spreadsheets to track tasks"
```

→ **Insight**: Tools either too simple or too complex, fall back to spreadsheets

---

**Meta-patterns** (Relationships between themes):

```
"Management visibility needs"
        ↓
   Forces
        ↓
"Manual reporting overhead"
        ↓
   Causes
        ↓
"Coordination failures"
        ↓
   Leads to
        ↓
"Tool adoption challenges" (try new tool, doesn't solve root cause)
```

**Root cause**: Management needs visibility → Forces PMs to manually report → Takes time away from coordination → Deadlines missed → Try new tool → Tool doesn't solve reporting problem → Back to spreadsheets

**Opportunity**: Break the cycle with automated visibility that doesn't require manual reporting

---

### Step 5: Insight Extraction

**Good Insight Formula**:

```
Observation + Pattern + Implication
```

**Bad insights** (Too vague):

```
❌ "Users don't like the UI"
❌ "Product is confusing"
❌ "People want more features"
```

**Good insights** (Specific, surprising, actionable):

```
✓ "5/8 users abandoned task at 'Add Members' step because 'team member' vs 'collaborator' label was ambiguous, suggesting we need clearer labeling and examples"

✓ "All enterprise customers (4/4) mentioned they can't roll out tool company-wide without SSO. SSO is table-stakes for enterprise, not a nice-to-have."

✓ "Users who spent 2+ hours/week on manual reporting (6/10) were willing to pay 3x more for automated reporting, indicating high-value feature opportunity"
```

**Good insights are**:

- **Specific**: Numbers, examples, exact scenarios
- **Surprising**: Challenges assumptions, unexpected pattern
- **Actionable**: Clear what to do next

---

### Insight Template

```
INSIGHT: [One-sentence summary]

EVIDENCE:
- Observation 1 (Participant X)
- Observation 2 (Participant Y)
- Observation 3 (Participant Z)

PATTERN:
[How many participants? What's the commonality?]

IMPLICATIONS:
- Product: [What should we build/change?]
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low urgency?]
- Risk if ignored: [What happens if we don't act?]

QUOTES:
- "[Most compelling verbatim quote]" - Participant X
- "[Supporting quote]" - Participant Y
```

---

### Example Insights

**Insight 1**:

```
INSIGHT: Enterprise customers can't adopt without SSO (Single Sign-On)

EVIDENCE:
- P2 (500-person company): "Can't even show this to security team without SSO"
- P4 (1000-person company): "We have a policy - no new tools without SSO"
- P6 (750-person company): "Would need SSO before piloting"
- P8 (2000-person company): "SSO is non-negotiable for us"

PATTERN: 4/4 enterprise participants (500+ employees) mentioned SSO as blocker

IMPLICATIONS:
- Product: SSO is table-stakes for enterprise, not differentiator
- Priority: HIGH - blocks entire market segment
- Risk: Can't win enterprise deals without it

QUOTES:
- "SSO isn't a nice-to-have. It's the entry ticket to even have the conversation." - P4
```

**Insight 2**:

```
INSIGHT: Users willing to pay 3x more to eliminate manual reporting

EVIDENCE:
- P1: Currently pays $15/user, would pay $50/user for automated reports
- P3: Spends 2hrs/week on manual reports, "easily worth $100/month to automate"
- P4: "Would switch from current tool ($10/user) to yours ($30/user) just for reporting"
- P7: "If you automated our weekly status report, we'd pay double"

PATTERN: 6/10 participants mentioned manual reporting as top pain, willing to pay premium

IMPLICATIONS:
- Product: Automated reporting is high-value feature
- Priority: HIGH - 3x price premium opportunity
- Risk: Competitors adding this will steal customers

QUOTES:
- "I'd pay anything to get those 2 hours back every week. Seriously, 3x the price? Done." - P3
```

- [ ] Capture verbatim quotes
- [ ] Note body language and tone
- [ ] Do immediate debrief (5-10 min after)

**After each interview**:

- [ ] Save recording with clear naming
- [ ] Review transcript within 24 hours
- [ ] Extract key quotes
- [ ] Update observation log
- [ ] Note patterns emerging

**After 3-5 interviews** (Mid-way):

- [ ] Start affinity mapping
- [ ] Identify early patterns
- [ ] Adjust interview guide if needed
- [ ] Check if reaching saturation (same themes repeating)

**After all interviews**:

- [ ] Complete affinity mapping
- [ ] Extract 3-5 key insights
