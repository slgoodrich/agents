## Executive Summary

**Research Goal**
Understand why enterprise customers (500+ employees) aren't adopting our project management tool despite initial interest.

**Methodology**
- 12 interviews with PMs at enterprise companies (500-2000 employees)
- Conducted Feb 1-15, 2024
- Recruited via LinkedIn + existing leads

**Key Findings**
1. SSO (Single Sign-On) is a hard blocker, not a nice-to-have
   - Evidence: 11/12 participants cited SSO as requirement before even piloting
   - Impact: We can't win enterprise deals without SSO

2. Enterprise customers need audit logs and activity tracking for compliance
   - Evidence: 8/12 mentioned SOC2/compliance requirements
   - Impact: Compliance features are table-stakes, not differentiators

3. Pricing is secondary to security and compliance
   - Evidence: 10/12 said they'd pay 2-3x more if security features were included
   - Impact: Price isn't the barrier - missing features are

**Recommendations**
1. [HIGH] Build SSO integration (SAML) - Required to enter enterprise market
2. [HIGH] Add audit logs and activity tracking - Required for compliance
3. [MEDIUM] Create enterprise security page on website - Helps sales conversations

**Next Steps**
- Product to scope SSO work (Feb 20)
- Design to mockup audit logs (Feb 25)
- Marketing to create security content (March 1)
```

```

---

**3. Key Findings** (3-5 pages)

**Goal**: Document insights with evidence

**Structure for Each Finding**:

```
### Finding 1: [Headline Summary]

**Insight**
[1-2 sentences describing the pattern/insight]

**Evidence**
- [X/Y] participants mentioned [behavior]
- [Specific data point]
- [Pattern observed]

**Quotes**
> "[Powerful quote 1]" - Participant 3, PM at 500-person company
>
> "[Powerful quote 2]" - Participant 7, PM at 1000-person company

**Impact**
- **Product Implications**: [What this means for product]
- **Priority**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on frequency and impact]
- **Risk if Ignored**: [What happens if we don't act]

**Recommendation**
[Specific action to take based on this finding]
```

**Example**:
```
### Finding 1: SSO is Hard Requirement, Not Nice-to-Have

**Insight**
Enterprise customers (500+ employees) cannot even pilot our tool without SSO due to security policies. This is a binary gate, not a feature preference.

**Evidence**
- 11/12 participants mentioned SSO as requirement before any evaluation
- 4 participants said IT/security team would block any tool without SSO
- 3 participants said they couldn't even show mockups to decision makers without SSO roadmap
- Average company policy: "No new tools without SSO" (8 participants had written policies)

**Quotes**
> "SSO isn't a nice-to-have for us. It's the entry ticket to even have the conversation. Without it, IT won't let us pilot anything." - P4, Director of Product at 750-person SaaS company
>
> "I can't even fill out your signup form because it'll get flagged by our security team. We have a hard rule: SSO or nothing." - P8, Senior PM at 1200-person fintech

**Impact**
- **Product Implications**: SSO is table-stakes for enterprise (500+ employees), not a differentiator
- **Priority**: HIGH - Blocks entire market segment (>$10M ARR opportunity)
- **Risk if Ignored**: Cannot win any enterprise deals, limited to SMB market

**Recommendation**
Build SAML-based SSO integration as P0 for enterprise product line (target: Q2 2024)
```

- [Action X]: [Why we're NOT doing this despite it being mentioned]
```

**Example**:
```
## Recommendations

**Summary**
To successfully enter the enterprise market, we must build security and compliance features (SSO, audit logs, RBAC) before focusing on feature differentiation. Price is not the barrier - missing security features are.

**Prioritized Actions**

### Priority 1 (HIGH) - Must Build to Enter Enterprise

**1. Build SAML-based SSO Integration**
- **Why**: Hard blocker for 11/12 enterprise participants
- **Expected Impact**: Unlocks $10M+ ARR enterprise market
- **Effort**: 4-6 engineer weeks
- **Owner**: Eng team + Product
- **Timeline**: Q2 2024 (complete by end April)

**2. Add Audit Logs and Activity Tracking**
- **Why**: Required for SOC2 compliance (8/12 participants)
- **Expected Impact**: Meets compliance requirements for regulated industries
- **Effort**: 2-3 engineer weeks
- **Owner**: Eng team
- **Timeline**: Q2 2024 (after SSO)

### Priority 2 (MEDIUM) - Improves Conversion

**3. Create Enterprise Security Page on Website**
- **Why**: Sales needs to reference security features in conversations
- **Expected Impact**: Reduces security objections, shortens sales cycle
- **Effort**: 1 designer week + 0.5 eng week
- **Owner**: Marketing + Design
- **Timeline**: March 2024

### Priority 3 (LOW) - Nice to Have

**4. Custom Onboarding for Enterprise**
- **Why**: 3 participants mentioned complex onboarding for large teams
- **Expected Impact**: Faster time-to-value, better retention
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Owner**: CS team
- **Timeline**: Q3 2024

**Not Recommended**
- Lower pricing for enterprise: 10/12 said they'd pay 2-3x more for security features, so price isn't the barrier

Subject: [Research Update] Enterprise PM Tool Research - SSO is Hard Blocker

Hi team,

Quick update on enterprise research. Here's what we learned:

**TL;DR**
SSO is a hard requirement (not nice-to-have) for all enterprise customers. We can't win deals without it.

**What We Did**
- 12 interviews with PMs at 500-2000 person companies
- Dates: Feb 1-15

**Key Findings**
1. SSO blocks 100% of enterprise deals: 11/12 participants said IT policy requires SSO before pilot
2. Compliance features (audit logs) required: 8/12 need for SOC2
3. Price is NOT the barrier: 10/12 would pay 2-3x more for security features

**Best Quote**
"SSO isn't a nice-to-have. It's the entry ticket. Without it, IT won't let us pilot anything." - Director of Product, 750-person SaaS company

**Recommendations**
1. [HIGH] Build SAML SSO - Q2 2024 target
2. [HIGH] Add audit logs - After SSO
3. [MEDIUM] Create enterprise security page - March

**Next Steps**
- Product to scope SSO work by Feb 20
- Design to mockup audit logs by Feb 25

## Part 6: Storytelling with Research

### The Story Arc

Research findings are more compelling when told as a story.

**Structure**:

```
1. Setup (Context)
   "We noticed [problem]. We wanted to understand why."

2. Journey (Research)
   "We talked to [X] users who [criteria]"

3. Discovery (Insights)
   "Here's what we learned that surprised us..."

4. Climax (Key Insight)
   "The real problem isn't [what we thought], it's [actual insight]"

5. Resolution (Recommendation)
   "So here's what we should do..."
```

**Example**:
```
SETUP:
"Enterprise customers were signing up but not converting to paid. We assumed it was price."

JOURNEY:
"We interviewed 12 enterprise PMs to understand why they weren't buying."

DISCOVERY:
"Turns out, price wasn't even a concern. Every single person mentioned security features."

CLIMAX:
"The real blocker? We're missing table-stakes security features like SSO. They can't even pilot our tool without it due to IT policies."

RESOLUTION:
"So we're building SSO in Q2. This unlocks a $10M+ market we currently can't access."
```

### Using Quotes Effectively

**Bad Quote Usage**:
```
Finding: Users find the UI confusing
Quote: "It's confusing." - P3
```
[Too short, no context, not impactful]

**Good Quote Usage**:
```
Finding: Users find the UI confusing

Quote:
"I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to archive a project. I clicked 'Delete' thinking it would give me more options, and it just... deleted everything. No confirmation, no undo. I almost quit right there." - P3, PM at 200-person startup

[Specific, emotional, shows severity]
```

**Pull Quote Format** (For slides/reports):
```
[Large, prominent display]

"I'd pay anything to get those 2 hours back every week.
Seriously, 3x the price? Done."

— Sarah Chen, Director of Product
   750-person SaaS company
```
