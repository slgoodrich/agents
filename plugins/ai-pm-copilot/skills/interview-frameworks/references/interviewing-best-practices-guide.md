# Interviewing Best Practices: Complete Guide

## Overview

Comprehensive guide to conducting effective user interviews, covering preparation, execution, common pitfalls, and advanced techniques. Based on frameworks from Teresa Torres ("Continuous Discovery Habits"), Erika Hall ("Just Enough Research"), and Rob Fitzpatrick ("The Mom Test").

---

## Part 1: Before the Interview

### Preparation Checklist

**Research the Participant** (15-30 minutes):
```
- [ ] LinkedIn profile (role, background, tenure)
- [ ] Company website (what they do, size, stage)
- [ ] Recent posts or articles they've written
- [ ] Any context from screener responses

Why: Shows respect, allows personalization, provides context
```

**Review Previous Interviews** (If series):
```
- [ ] Read notes from previous participants
- [ ] Review emerging patterns
- [ ] Note questions to explore deeper
- [ ] Check if this participant offers different perspective

Why: Builds on previous learning, tests hypotheses
```

**Test Technology** (5 minutes before):
```
- [ ] Video conferencing tool working
- [ ] Audio quality good (use headphones)
- [ ] Recording enabled and tested
- [ ] Backup recording method ready
- [ ] Screen share working (if needed)
- [ ] Note-taking template open

Why: Technical issues waste participant time, hurt credibility
```

**Set Up Environment**:
```
- [ ] Quiet space (no interruptions)
- [ ] Good lighting (for video)
- [ ] Water nearby
- [ ] Phone silenced
- [ ] Slack/email notifications off
- [ ] Calendar blocked for 15 min after (debrief time)

Why: Full focus on participant, no distractions
```

### Interview Guide Preparation

**Structure Your Guide**:
```
1. Opening (5 min): Build rapport, set expectations
2. Context (10 min): Understand their world
3. Core questions (10-15 min): Dive into topic
4. Closing (5 min): Priorities, referrals, thank you

Total: 30-35 minutes (leave buffer)
```

**Write Questions, Not a Script**:
```
✓ Bullet points: Key topics to cover
✓ Open-ended questions: "How do you...?"
✓ Follow-up probes: "Tell me more", "Can you give an example?"

❌ Word-for-word script: Sounds robotic, inflexible
❌ Closed questions: "Do you...?" (yes/no)
❌ Leading questions: "Don't you think...?"
```

**Example Guide**:
```
OPENING (5 min)
- Thanks, intro, expectations
- Permission to record
- Their role and background

CONTEXT (10 min)
- Walk me through typical day/week
- Main responsibilities
- Tools you use
- Team structure

PROBLEM AREA (15 min)
- What's hard about [task]?
- Tell me about last time [problem] came up
- How do you currently solve it?
- What's frustrating about current solution?
- [Follow-ups based on responses]

CLOSING (5 min)
- Most important problem to solve?
- What haven't I asked?
- Who else should I talk to?
- Thank you, gift card timing
```

---

## Part 2: During the Interview

### Opening Strong

**Build Rapport** (First 2-3 minutes):
```
1. Warm greeting
   "Hi [Name]! Thanks so much for making time to chat."

2. Small talk (briefly)
   "How's your day going?"
   "Where are you joining from?"
   [Just 30-60 seconds - don't overdo it]

3. Transition to interview
   "Should we dive in?"
```

**Set Clear Expectations**:
```
"Here's what to expect today:

1. Time: About 30 minutes
2. Topic: I'm researching [problem area] and want to learn from your experience
3. No right answers: I'm here to listen and understand, not test you
4. Recording: Can I record for my notes? Only our team sees it.
5. Questions: Feel free to ask clarifying questions anytime

Sound good?"
```

**Why this works**:
- Reduces anxiety (they know what to expect)
- Sets collaborative tone (not interrogation)
- Gets permission (recording, time)
- Opens door for their questions

---

### The 80/20 Rule

**You speak 20%, they speak 80%**

**Your 20%**:
- Ask questions
- Light follow-ups ("Tell me more")
- Clarify what they said
- Bridge between topics

**Their 80%**:
- Answer questions
- Tell stories
- Explain context
- Share opinions and feelings

**Red flags you're talking too much**:
- You're explaining your product (discovery phase)
- You're debating their points
- You're filling every silence
- You're telling your own stories
- Transcript shows your name more than theirs

**How to fix**:
- Ask open-ended question, then STOP
- Count to 5 in silence before asking next question
- Use "tell me more" instead of new questions
- Practice active listening (nod, "mm-hmm", but don't interrupt)

---

### Active Listening Techniques

**Show You're Listening** (Non-verbal):
```
- Eye contact (look at camera for video)
- Nodding (periodically, not constantly)
- Lean slightly forward (shows engagement)
- Take notes (they can see you value what they're saying)
- Facial expressions (react to what they say)
```

**Show You're Listening** (Verbal):
```
- "Mm-hmm" (encourages them to continue)
- "I see" (acknowledges understanding)
- "That's interesting" (shows engagement)
- "Tell me more about that" (deepens topic)
- Paraphrase: "So if I understand correctly, you...?" (confirms understanding)
```

**Don't**:
```
❌ Look at second monitor
❌ Type loudly (distracting)
❌ Multitask (check email, Slack)
❌ Interrupt mid-thought
❌ Finish their sentences
❌ Jump to next question before they're done
```

---

### The Power of Silence

**Technique**: After they answer, stay silent for 3-5 seconds

**Why it works**:
- People feel compelled to fill silence
- They often add more important details after pausing
- Shows you're processing what they said
- Gives them space to think deeper

**Example**:
```
Researcher: "What's frustrating about your current process?"

Participant: "Oh, it's pretty annoying."

[Researcher: STAYS SILENT, nods]

Participant: "Actually, now that I think about it, I almost quit over it last month. It was that bad. I was spending 10 hours a week on it."

[Silence revealed the real severity]
```

**How to practice**:
- Count to 5 in your head before asking next question
- Resist urge to fill silence immediately
- If truly done, they'll move on or ask "what else?"
- Gets easier with practice

---

### Probing Techniques

**When to Probe**:
- Answer is vague or general
- Something surprising
- Contradicts previous statement
- Surface-level response (need to go deeper)

**How to Probe**:

**1. The Echo**
```
Repeat their last few words as a question

Participant: "The process takes forever."
You: "Takes forever?"
Participant: "Yeah, like 4 hours minimum. Sometimes a full day."
```

**2. The Example Request**
```
Participant: "The UI is confusing."
You: "Can you give me a specific example of when it confused you?"
Participant: "Yeah, yesterday I tried to archive a project..."
```

**3. The Naive Question**
```
Participant: "We do continuous deployment."
You: "Help me understand - what does continuous deployment mean in your context?"
[Don't assume - get their definition]
```

**4. The "Tell Me More"**
```
Most powerful three words in interviewing

Participant: "It's frustrating."
You: "Tell me more about that."
Participant: [Elaborates for 2 minutes]
```

**5. The Ladder**
```
Keep asking "why" or "why does that matter?"

"Why is real-time collaboration important?"
→ "So team can work together"
→ "Why does that matter?"
→ "We finish faster"
→ "Why does speed matter?"
→ "I can go home on time"
```

---

### Handling Difficult Situations

**Situation 1: One-Word Answers**

**Problem**: "Yes", "No", "I don't know"

**Fix**:
```
"Can you walk me through an example?"
"Help me understand what you mean by that?"
"Tell me more about your experience with..."
"What does a typical [process] look like for you?"
```

**Example**:
```
You: "Do you find it frustrating?"
Them: "Yeah."
[Dead end]

Better:
You: "What's frustrating about it?"
Them: "Well, it takes forever and always breaks..."
[Much more detail]
```

---

**Situation 2: They're Pitching You Back**

**Problem**: They want to sell you their product/service

**Fix**:
```
"I appreciate that! But right now I'm focused on learning from your experience rather than solutions. Let me ask you about [topic]..."

[Redirect firmly but politely]
```

---

**Situation 3: They Ask What You Think**

**Problem**: "What do you think about X?" or "Is that what you wanted to hear?"

**Fix**:
```
"I'm curious what you think first - there's no right answer here."
"Your perspective is what's valuable to me."
"I'll share my thoughts at the end, but right now I want to hear from you."
```

**Why**: Their unbiased opinion is what you need, not validation

---

**Situation 4: They're Clearly Lying to Be Polite**

**Problem**: Saying positive things but body language shows discomfort

**Fix**:
```
"I'm sensing some hesitation - please tell me honestly, what concerns you?"
"The critical feedback is actually the most helpful - it's what helps us improve."
"You won't hurt my feelings - I need to hear the truth."
```

**Example**:
```
You: "What do you think of this mockup?"
Them: "Oh, it's... nice." [But frowning, hesitant]

You: "You seem hesitant. What's actually going through your mind?"
Them: "Honestly? I'm confused what this button does and the layout seems crowded."
[Real feedback emerged]
```

---

**Situation 5: Participant is Off-Topic**

**Problem**: Long tangents unrelated to research

**Fix**:
```
"That's really interesting. I want to make sure I get to [topic] in our time together. Can I steer us back to [question]?"

[Acknowledge, but redirect]
```

**Balance**: Some tangents are valuable (reveals context). But if 10+ minutes off-topic, redirect.

---

**Situation 6: Technical Issues**

**Problem**: Video/audio problems, recording failed, etc.

**Fix**:
```
1. Stay calm
2. "Let me try to fix this quickly - one moment"
3. If can't fix in 2 minutes: "Let's continue without [recording/video], I'll take detailed notes"
4. Apologize briefly, move on
5. After interview: Send follow-up with any questions you missed
```

---

### Questions to Avoid

**Leading Questions**

❌ "Don't you think it would be better if...?"
❌ "Wouldn't it be great if...?"
❌ "I bet you'd love a feature that..."
❌ "Most people say X, do you agree?"

✓ "How would you improve this?"
✓ "What's your reaction to this?"
✓ "What would make this better for you?"

**Why**: Leading questions suggest the answer you want, bias responses

---

**Hypothetical Future Questions**

❌ "Would you use this?"
❌ "If we built X, would you switch?"
❌ "How often would you use this feature?"
❌ "Would you pay $X for this?"

✓ "How often do you currently [related task]?"
✓ "Walk me through the last time you tried [alternative]"
✓ "What did you pay for [current solution]?"

**Why**: People are terrible at predicting future behavior, but accurate about past behavior

---

**Yes/No Questions**

❌ "Do you like this?"
❌ "Is this useful?"
❌ "Does this make sense?"
❌ "Is this a problem for you?"

✓ "What's your reaction to this?"
✓ "How would you use this in your workflow?"
✓ "Help me understand your current process"
✓ "Tell me about the last time [problem] came up"

**Why**: Yes/no shuts down conversation, open-ended questions encourage elaboration

---

**Multi-Part Questions**

❌ "How often do you use it and what features do you use and what do you think of the UI?"

✓ Ask separately:
   "How often do you use it?" [Pause, listen]
   "Which features do you use?" [Pause, listen]
   "What's your take on the UI?" [Pause, listen]

**Why**: Multi-part confuses people, they only answer one part, you lose the rest

---

**Jargon or Assumed Knowledge**

❌ "Do you use CI/CD in your workflow?"
   [Assumes they know these acronyms]

✓ "How do you handle testing and deployment?"
   [Plain language, they'll describe their process]

**Why**: Jargon confuses, makes them feel dumb, plain language works for everyone

---

## Part 4: Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Pitching Your Solution (Discovery Phase)

**What it looks like**:
```
Participant: "Yeah, the current process is annoying."
You: "Great! So our product solves that by..." [Launches into pitch]
```

**Why it's bad**:
- You're not learning, you're selling
- Biases their responses
- Misses opportunity to understand root cause
- They'll be polite instead of honest

**Fix**:
```
Participant: "Yeah, the current process is annoying."
You: "Tell me more about what's annoying. Walk me through the last time it happened."
[Keep exploring, don't pitch]
```

---

### Mistake 2: Confirmation Bias

**What it looks like**:
```
You have a hypothesis: "Users need feature X"
You only hear responses that confirm it
You ignore or downplay responses that contradict it
```

**Why it's bad**:
- Leads to building wrong thing
- Wastes time and money
- Misses real problems

**Fix**:
- Actively look for disconfirming evidence
- Ask questions that could prove you wrong
- "What would make this NOT work for you?"
- Bring skeptical team member to interviews

---

### Mistake 3: Asking About Future Behavior

**What it looks like**:
```
"Would you use this?"
"How much would you pay for this?"
"If we built X, would you switch?"
```

**Why it's bad**:
- People are terrible at predicting future behavior
- 90% say yes, 5% actually do it
- False validation

**Fix**:
```
Ask about past behavior:
"When's the last time you tried a new tool? What made you switch?"
"What did you pay for your current solution? Why that amount?"
"Walk me through your decision process when you chose [current tool]"
```

---

### Mistake 4: Talking More Than Listening

**What it looks like**:
- You're explaining your product for 10 minutes
- You're debating their points
- You're telling your own stories
- Transcript shows you speaking 50%+

**Why it's bad**:
- Wastes their time
- You learn nothing
- Biases their responses

**Fix**:
- 80/20 rule: They speak 80%, you speak 20%
- Ask question, then STOP talking
- Use silence (count to 5)
- "Tell me more" instead of new questions

---

### Mistake 5: Sample Size Too Small

**What it looks like**:
- 2-3 interviews, drawing big conclusions
- "Users want feature X" (based on 1 person)

**Why it's bad**:
- Outliers not patterns
- False confidence
- Build wrong things

**Fix**:
- Minimum 5-8 interviews before drawing conclusions
- Look for patterns (3+ people mention same thing)
- Continue until reaching saturation (stop hearing new things)
- 10-15 interviews typical for discovery research

---

### Mistake 6: Wrong Participants

**What it looks like**:
- Interviewing people who don't match target market
- Friends and family (too biased)
- Professional research participants (too experienced)

**Why it's bad**:
- Insights don't apply to real users
- False validation
- Wasted time

**Fix**:
- Clear recruitment criteria
- Screen rigorously
- Disqualify if not right fit
- Aim for diversity within target segment

---

### Mistake 7: Leading Questions

**What it looks like**:
```
"Don't you think it would be better if...?"
"Most people love this feature, what do you think?"
"Wouldn't it be great if...?"
```

**Why it's bad**:
- Suggests answer you want
- Biases responses
- People want to agree with you (social desirability bias)

**Fix**:
```
Neutral questions:
"What's your reaction to this?"
"How would you improve this?"
"What would make this valuable for you?"
```

---

### Mistake 8: Not Recording

**What it looks like**:
- Furiously taking notes
- Missing important details
- Can't make eye contact
- Forget key quotes

**Why it's bad**:
- Divided attention (note-taking vs listening)
- Miss nuances (tone, emotion, body language)
- Can't verify later
- Hard to share with team

**Fix**:
- Always ask to record
- 95% say yes
- If they say no, take thorough notes but still focus on listening
- Use AI transcription tools (Otter, Grain)

---

## Part 5: Advanced Techniques

### Pattern Recognition Across Interviews

**After 3-5 interviews, look for**:

**Convergence** (Multiple people say same thing):
```
"Takes too long" mentioned by P1, P3, P4, P6
→ STRONG SIGNAL: Speed is a priority

"Confusing UI" mentioned by P2, P5
→ WEAK SIGNAL: Might be specific to those users
```

**Divergence** (People contradict each other):
```
P1: "I want more features"
P3: "It's too complex already"
→ SEGMENT DIFFERENCE: Different user needs or segments
```

**Surprises** (Unexpected insights):
```
Expected: "Price is main concern"
Actual: "Don't care about price, care about time savings"
→ PIVOT: Focus on time, not cost
```

---

### Hypothesis Testing

**State hypotheses before research**:
```
H1: Users struggle with [X]
H2: Current solution for [X] is [Y]
H3: Users would pay for automated [Z]
```

**Design questions to test (not confirm)**:
```
To test H1: "Walk me through your process for [X]"
To test H2: "What do you currently use for [X]?"
To test H3: "How much time/money does [Z] cost you now?"
```

**After interviews, update**:
```
H1: ✓ CONFIRMED (7/10 mentioned struggle)
H2: ✗ REJECTED (Using W, not Y)
H3: ? UNCLEAR (Mixed responses, need more data)
```

---

### Rolling Synthesis

**Don't wait until all interviews done to analyze**:

**After every 3-5 interviews**:
```
1. Review all notes
2. Update affinity map
3. Identify patterns
4. Adjust interview guide for remaining interviews
5. Check if reaching saturation (same themes repeating)
```

**Benefits**:
- Catch issues early (adjust guide)
- Know when to stop (saturation reached)
- Faster insights (don't wait weeks)
- Team stays aligned (regular check-ins)

---

## Part 6: Ethical Considerations

### Informed Consent

**Always get explicit consent for**:
- Recording (audio/video)
- Using quotes publicly
- Sharing with team
- Using in case studies

**Template**:
```
"I'll be recording this conversation for my notes. Only our team will see it. Is that OK?"

[If using publicly]
"We may use anonymized quotes in presentations. Would that be OK? I won't use your name or company."
```

---

### Anonymity and Privacy

**Protect participant identity**:
```
- Use codes in notes (P1, P2, P3)
- Remove identifying info from quotes
- Don't share participant lists outside team
- Secure recordings (password-protected, don't share publicly)
- Delete recordings after project (or after agreed retention period)
```

---

### Respect Their Time

**Be punctual**:
```
- Start on time (be ready 5 min early)
- End on time (watch clock)
- If running over: "I know we're at time. Can I ask one more question or should we wrap up?"
```

**Honor commitments**:
```
- Send gift card within 24 hours (as promised)
- Follow up if you said you would
- Share research findings if they asked
```

---

## Part 7: Continuous Improvement

### Self-Evaluation After Each Interview

**Rate yourself**:
```
- Did I talk more than 20%? (Y/N)
- Did I ask leading questions? (Y/N)
- Did I probe surface-level answers? (Y/N)
- Did I use silence effectively? (Y/N)
- Did I stay on time? (Y/N)
- Did I capture good quotes? (Y/N)
```

**What to improve next time**:
```
- Specific behaviors to change
- Questions that worked well (keep)
- Questions that didn't (revise)
```

---

### Get Feedback

**From participants** (Optional, end of interview):
```
"One last question - do you have any feedback on this interview? Anything I should have asked differently?"
```

**From team** (Review recordings together):
```
- Watch recordings as team
- Give each other feedback
- Learn from each other's techniques
- Calibrate approach
```

---

**Key Principle**: Great interviews come from preparation, active listening, and continuous improvement. Focus on understanding, not validating. Listen more than you talk. Ask about past behavior, not future intentions. Probe surface-level answers. Use silence. Learn from every interview.
