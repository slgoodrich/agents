## Part 1: Before the Interview

### Preparation Checklist

**Research the Participant** (15-30 minutes):

```
- [ ] LinkedIn profile (role, background, tenure)
- [ ] Company website (what they do, size, stage)
- [ ] Recent posts or articles they've written
- [ ] Any context from screener responses

Why: Shows respect, allows personalization, provides context
```

**Review Previous Interviews** (If series):

```
- [ ] Read notes from previous participants
- [ ] Review emerging patterns
- [ ] Note questions to explore deeper
- [ ] Check if this participant offers different perspective

Why: Builds on previous learning, tests hypotheses
```

**Test Technology** (5 minutes before):

```
- [ ] Video conferencing tool working
- [ ] Audio quality good (use headphones)
- [ ] Recording enabled and tested
- [ ] Backup recording method ready
- [ ] Screen share working (if needed)
- [ ] Note-taking template open

Why: Technical issues waste participant time, hurt credibility
```

**Set Up Environment**:

```
- [ ] Quiet space (no interruptions)
- [ ] Good lighting (for video)
- [ ] Water nearby
- [ ] Phone silenced
- [ ] Slack/email notifications off
- [ ] Calendar blocked for 15 min after (debrief time)

Why: Full focus on participant, no distractions
```

### Interview Guide Preparation

**Structure Your Guide**:

```
1. Opening (5 min): Build rapport, set expectations
2. Context (10 min): Understand their world
3. Core questions (10-15 min): Dive into topic
4. Closing (5 min): Priorities, referrals, thank you

Total: 30-35 minutes (leave buffer)
```

**Write Questions, Not a Script**:

```
✓ Bullet points: Key topics to cover
✓ Open-ended questions: "How do you...?"
✓ Follow-up probes: "Tell me more", "Can you give an example?"

❌ Word-for-word script: Sounds robotic, inflexible
❌ Closed questions: "Do you...?" (yes/no)
❌ Leading questions: "Don't you think...?"
```

**Example Guide**:

```
OPENING (5 min)
- Thanks, intro, expectations
- Permission to record
- Their role and background

CONTEXT (10 min)
- Walk me through typical day/week
- Main responsibilities
- Tools you use
- Team structure

PROBLEM AREA (15 min)
- What's hard about [task]?
- Tell me about last time [problem] came up
- How do you currently solve it?
- What's frustrating about current solution?
- [Follow-ups based on responses]

CLOSING (5 min)
- Most important problem to solve?
- What haven't I asked?
- Who else should I talk to?
- Thank you, gift card timing
```

---

## Part 2: During the Interview

### Opening Strong

**Build Rapport** (First 2-3 minutes):

```
1. Warm greeting
   "Hi [Name]! Thanks so much for making time to chat."

2. Small talk (briefly)
   "How's your day going?"
   "Where are you joining from?"
   [Just 30-60 seconds - don't overdo it]

3. Transition to interview
   "Should we dive in?"
```

**Set Clear Expectations**:

```
"Here's what to expect today:

1. Time: About 30 minutes
2. Topic: I'm researching [problem area] and want to learn from your experience
3. No right answers: I'm here to listen and understand, not test you
4. Recording: Can I record for my notes? Only our team sees it.
5. Questions: Feel free to ask clarifying questions anytime

Sound good?"
```

**Why this works**:

- Reduces anxiety (they know what to expect)
- Sets collaborative tone (not interrogation)
- Gets permission (recording, time)
- Opens door for their questions

---

### The 80/20 Rule

**You speak 20%, they speak 80%**

**Your 20%**:

- Ask questions
- Light follow-ups ("Tell me more")
- Clarify what they said
- Bridge between topics

**Their 80%**:

- Answer questions
- Tell stories
- Explain context
- Share opinions and feelings

**Red flags you're talking too much**:

- You're explaining your product (discovery phase)
- You're debating their points
- You're filling every silence
- You're telling your own stories
- Transcript shows your name more than theirs

**How to fix**:

- Ask open-ended question, then STOP
- Count to 5 in silence before asking next question
- Use "tell me more" instead of new questions
- Practice active listening (nod, "mm-hmm", but don't interrupt)

---

### Active Listening Techniques

**Show You're Listening** (Non-verbal):

```
- Eye contact (look at camera for video)
- Nodding (periodically, not constantly)
- Lean slightly forward (shows engagement)
- Take notes (they can see you value what they're saying)
- Facial expressions (react to what they say)
```

**Show You're Listening** (Verbal):

```
- "Mm-hmm" (encourages them to continue)
- "I see" (acknowledges understanding)
- "That's interesting" (shows engagement)
- "Tell me more about that" (deepens topic)
- Paraphrase: "So if I understand correctly, you...?" (confirms understanding)
```

**Don't**:

```
❌ Look at second monitor
❌ Type loudly (distracting)
❌ Multitask (check email, Slack)
❌ Interrupt mid-thought
❌ Finish their sentences
❌ Jump to next question before they're done
```

---

### The Power of Silence

**Technique**: After they answer, stay silent for 3-5 seconds

**Why it works**:

- People feel compelled to fill silence
- They often add more important details after pausing
- Shows you're processing what they said
- Gives them space to think deeper

**Example**:

```
Researcher: "What's frustrating about your current process?"

Participant: "Oh, it's pretty annoying."

[Researcher: STAYS SILENT, nods]

Participant: "Actually, now that I think about it, I almost quit over it last month. It was that bad. I was spending 10 hours a week on it."

[Silence revealed the real severity]
```

**How to practice**:

- Count to 5 in your head before asking next question
- Resist urge to fill silence immediately
- If truly done, they'll move on or ask "what else?"
- Gets easier with practice

---

### Probing Techniques

**When to Probe**:

- Answer is vague or general
- Something surprising
- Contradicts previous statement
- Surface-level response (need to go deeper)

**How to Probe**:

**1. The Echo**

```
Repeat their last few words as a question

Participant: "The process takes forever."
You: "Takes forever?"
Participant: "Yeah, like 4 hours minimum. Sometimes a full day."
```

**2. The Example Request**

```
Participant: "The UI is confusing."
You: "Can you give me a specific example of when it confused you?"
Participant: "Yeah, yesterday I tried to archive a project..."
```

**3. The Naive Question**

```
Participant: "We do continuous deployment."
You: "Help me understand - what does continuous deployment mean in your context?"
[Don't assume - get their definition]
```

**4. The "Tell Me More"**

```
Most powerful three words in interviewing

Participant: "It's frustrating."
You: "Tell me more about that."
Participant: [Elaborates for 2 minutes]
```

**5. The Ladder**

```
Keep asking "why" or "why does that matter?"

"Why is real-time collaboration important?"
→ "So team can work together"
→ "Why does that matter?"
→ "We finish faster"
→ "Why does speed matter?"
→ "I can go home on time"
```

---

### Handling Difficult Situations

**Situation 1: One-Word Answers**

**Problem**: "Yes", "No", "I don't know"

**Fix**:

```
"Can you walk me through an example?"
"Help me understand what you mean by that?"
"Tell me more about your experience with..."
"What does a typical [process] look like for you?"
```

**Example**:

```
You: "Do you find it frustrating?"
Them: "Yeah."
[Dead end]

Better:
You: "What's frustrating about it?"
Them: "Well, it takes forever and always breaks..."
[Much more detail]
```

---

**Situation 2: They're Pitching You Back**

**Problem**: They want to sell you their product/service

**Fix**:

```
"I appreciate that! But right now I'm focused on learning from your experience rather than solutions. Let me ask you about [topic]..."

[Redirect firmly but politely]
```

---

**Situation 3: They Ask What You Think**

**Problem**: "What do you think about X?" or "Is that what you wanted to hear?"

**Fix**:

```
"I'm curious what you think first - there's no right answer here."
"Your perspective is what's valuable to me."
"I'll share my thoughts at the end, but right now I want to hear from you."
```

**Why**: Their unbiased opinion is what you need, not validation

---

**Situation 4: They're Clearly Lying to Be Polite**

**Problem**: Saying positive things but body language shows discomfort

**Fix**:

```
"I'm sensing some hesitation - please tell me honestly, what concerns you?"
"The critical feedback is actually the most helpful - it's what helps us improve."
"You won't hurt my feelings - I need to hear the truth."
```

**Example**:

```
You: "What do you think of this mockup?"
Them: "Oh, it's... nice." [But frowning, hesitant]

You: "You seem hesitant. What's actually going through your mind?"
Them: "Honestly? I'm confused what this button does and the layout seems crowded."
[Real feedback emerged]
```

---

**Situation 5: Participant is Off-Topic**

**Problem**: Long tangents unrelated to research

**Fix**:

```
"That's really interesting. I want to make sure I get to [topic] in our time together. Can I steer us back to [question]?"

[Acknowledge, but redirect]
```

**Balance**: Some tangents are valuable (reveals context). But if 10+ minutes off-topic, redirect.

---

**Situation 6: Technical Issues**

**Problem**: Video/audio problems, recording failed, etc.

**Fix**:

```
1. Stay calm
2. "Let me try to fix this quickly - one moment"
3. If can't fix in 2 minutes: "Let's continue without [recording/video], I'll take detailed notes"
4. Apologize briefly, move on
5. After interview: Send follow-up with any questions you missed
```

---

### Questions to Avoid

**Leading Questions**

❌ "Don't you think it would be better if...?"
❌ "Wouldn't it be great if...?"
❌ "I bet you'd love a feature that..."
❌ "Most people say X, do you agree?"

✓ "How would you improve this?"
✓ "What's your reaction to this?"
✓ "What would make this better for you?"

**Why**: Leading questions suggest the answer you want, bias responses

---

**Hypothetical Future Questions**

❌ "Would you use this?"
❌ "If we built X, would you switch?"
❌ "How often would you use this feature?"
❌ "Would you pay $X for this?"

✓ "How often do you currently [related task]?"
✓ "Walk me through the last time you tried [alternative]"
✓ "What did you pay for [current solution]?"

**Why**: People are terrible at predicting future behavior, but accurate about past behavior

---

**Yes/No Questions**

❌ "Do you like this?"
❌ "Is this useful?"
❌ "Does this make sense?"
❌ "Is this a problem for you?"

✓ "What's your reaction to this?"
✓ "How would you use this in your workflow?"
✓ "Help me understand your current process"
✓ "Tell me about the last time [problem] came up"

**Why**: Yes/no shuts down conversation, open-ended questions encourage elaboration

---

**Multi-Part Questions**

❌ "How often do you use it and what features do you use and what do you think of the UI?"

✓ Ask separately:
"How often do you use it?" [Pause, listen]
"Which features do you use?" [Pause, listen]
"What's your take on the UI?" [Pause, listen]

**Why**: Multi-part confuses people, they only answer one part, you lose the rest

---

**Jargon or Assumed Knowledge**

❌ "Do you use CI/CD in your workflow?"
[Assumes they know these acronyms]

✓ "How do you handle testing and deployment?"
[Plain language, they'll describe their process]

**Why**: Jargon confuses, makes them feel dumb, plain language works for everyone

---

## Part 4: Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Pitching Your Solution (Discovery Phase)

**What it looks like**:

```
Participant: "Yeah, the current process is annoying."
You: "Great! So our product solves that by..." [Launches into pitch]
```

**Why it's bad**:

- You're not learning, you're selling
- Biases their responses
- Misses opportunity to understand root cause
- They'll be polite instead of honest

**Fix**:

```
Participant: "Yeah, the current process is annoying."
You: "Tell me more about what's annoying. Walk me through the last time it happened."
[Keep exploring, don't pitch]
```

---

### Mistake 2: Confirmation Bias

**What it looks like**:

```
You have a hypothesis: "Users need feature X"
You only hear responses that confirm it
You ignore or downplay responses that contradict it
```

**Why it's bad**:

- Leads to building wrong thing
- Wastes time and money
- Misses real problems

**Fix**:

- Actively look for disconfirming evidence
- Ask questions that could prove you wrong
- "What would make this NOT work for you?"
- Bring skeptical team member to interviews

---

### Mistake 3: Asking About Future Behavior

**What it looks like**:

```
"Would you use this?"
"How much would you pay for this?"
"If we built X, would you switch?"
```

**Why it's bad**:

- People are terrible at predicting future behavior
- 90% say yes, 5% actually do it
- False validation

**Fix**:

```
Ask about past behavior:
"When's the last time you tried a new tool? What made you switch?"
"What did you pay for your current solution? Why that amount?"
"Walk me through your decision process when you chose [current tool]"
```

---

### Mistake 4: Talking More Than Listening

**What it looks like**:

- You're explaining your product for 10 minutes
- You're debating their points
- You're telling your own stories
- Transcript shows you speaking 50%+

**Why it's bad**:

- Wastes their time
- You learn nothing
- Biases their responses

**Fix**:

- 80/20 rule: They speak 80%, you speak 20%
- Ask question, then STOP talking
- Use silence (count to 5)
- "Tell me more" instead of new questions

---

### Mistake 5: Sample Size Too Small

**What it looks like**:

- 2-3 interviews, drawing big conclusions
- "Users want feature X" (based on 1 person)

**Why it's bad**:

- Outliers not patterns
- False confidence
- Build wrong things

**Fix**:

- Minimum 5-8 interviews before drawing conclusions
- Look for patterns (3+ people mention same thing)
- Continue until reaching saturation (stop hearing new things)
- 10-15 interviews typical for discovery research

---

### Mistake 6: Wrong Participants

**What it looks like**:

- Interviewing people who don't match target market
- Friends and family (too biased)
- Professional research participants (too experienced)

**Why it's bad**:

- Insights don't apply to real users
- False validation
- Wasted time

**Fix**:

- Clear recruitment criteria
- Screen rigorously
- Disqualify if not right fit
- Aim for diversity within target segment

---

### Mistake 7: Leading Questions

**What it looks like**:

```
"Don't you think it would be better if...?"
"Most people love this feature, what do you think?"
"Wouldn't it be great if...?"
```

**Why it's bad**:

- Suggests answer you want
- Biases responses
- People want to agree with you (social desirability bias)

**Fix**:

```
Neutral questions:
"What's your reaction to this?"
"How would you improve this?"
"What would make this valuable for you?"
```

---

### Mistake 8: Not Recording

**What it looks like**:

- Furiously taking notes
- Missing important details
- Can't make eye contact
- Forget key quotes

**Why it's bad**:

- Divided attention (note-taking vs listening)
- Miss nuances (tone, emotion, body language)
- Can't verify later
- Hard to share with team

**Fix**:

- Always ask to record
- 95% say yes
- If they say no, take thorough notes but still focus on listening
- Use AI transcription tools (Otter, Grain)

---

## Part 5: Advanced Techniques

### Pattern Recognition Across Interviews

**After 3-5 interviews, look for**:

**Convergence** (Multiple people say same thing):

```
"Takes too long" mentioned by P1, P3, P4, P6
→ STRONG SIGNAL: Speed is a priority

"Confusing UI" mentioned by P2, P5
→ WEAK SIGNAL: Might be specific to those users
```

**Divergence** (People contradict each other):

```
P1: "I want more features"
P3: "It's too complex already"
→ SEGMENT DIFFERENCE: Different user needs or segments
```

**Surprises** (Unexpected insights):

```
Expected: "Price is main concern"
Actual: "Don't care about price, care about time savings"
→ PIVOT: Focus on time, not cost
```

---

### Hypothesis Testing

**State hypotheses before research**:

```
H1: Users struggle with [X]
H2: Current solution for [X] is [Y]
H3: Users would pay for automated [Z]
```

**Design questions to test (not confirm)**:

```
To test H1: "Walk me through your process for [X]"
To test H2: "What do you currently use for [X]?"
To test H3: "How much time/money does [Z] cost you now?"
```

**After interviews, update**:

```
H1: ✓ CONFIRMED (7/10 mentioned struggle)
H2: ✗ REJECTED (Using W, not Y)
H3: ? UNCLEAR (Mixed responses, need more data)
```

---

### Rolling Synthesis

**Don't wait until all interviews done to analyze**:

**After every 3-5 interviews**:

```
1. Review all notes
2. Update affinity map
3. Identify patterns
4. Adjust interview guide for remaining interviews
5. Check if reaching saturation (same themes repeating)
```

**Benefits**:

- Catch issues early (adjust guide)
- Know when to stop (saturation reached)
- Faster insights (don't wait weeks)
- Team stays aligned (regular check-ins)

---

## Part 6: Ethical Considerations

### Informed Consent

**Always get explicit consent for**:

- Recording (audio/video)
- Using quotes publicly
- Sharing with team
- Using in case studies

**Template**:

```
"I'll be recording this conversation for my notes. Only our team will see it. Is that OK?"

[If using publicly]
"We may use anonymized quotes in presentations. Would that be OK? I won't use your name or company."
```

---

### Anonymity and Privacy

**Protect participant identity**:

```
- Use codes in notes (P1, P2, P3)
- Remove identifying info from quotes
- Don't share participant lists outside team
- Secure recordings (password-protected, don't share publicly)
- Delete recordings after project (or after agreed retention period)
```

---

### Respect Their Time

**Be punctual**:

```
- Start on time (be ready 5 min early)
- End on time (watch clock)
- If running over: "I know we're at time. Can I ask one more question or should we wrap up?"
```

**Honor commitments**:

```
- Send gift card within 24 hours (as promised)
- Follow up if you said you would
- Share research findings if they asked
```

---

## Part 7: Continuous Improvement

### Self-Evaluation After Each Interview

**Rate yourself**:

```
- Did I talk more than 20%? (Y/N)
- Did I ask leading questions? (Y/N)
- Did I probe surface-level answers? (Y/N)
- Did I use silence effectively? (Y/N)
- Did I stay on time? (Y/N)
- Did I capture good quotes? (Y/N)
```

**What to improve next time**:

```
- Specific behaviors to change
- Questions that worked well (keep)
- Questions that didn't (revise)
```

---

### Get Feedback

**From participants** (Optional, end of interview):

```
"One last question - do you have any feedback on this interview? Anything I should have asked differently?"
```

**From team** (Review recordings together):

```
- Watch recordings as team
- Give each other feedback
- Learn from each other's techniques
- Calibrate approach
```

---

**Key Principle**: Great interviews come from preparation, active listening, and continuous improvement. Focus on understanding, not validating. Listen more than you talk. Ask about past behavior, not future intentions. Probe surface-level answers. Use silence. Learn from every interview.
