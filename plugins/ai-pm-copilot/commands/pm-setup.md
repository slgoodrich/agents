# PM Context Setup

Quick setup wizard to initialize `.claude/product-context/` with essential product information. Takes 5-10 minutes and enables all PM agents, commands, and workflows to work with your product context.

## Usage

```bash
/product-management:pm-setup
```

Or update existing context:
```bash
/product-management:pm-setup --update
```

---

## Overview

This command sets up the foundational context that powers the entire PM Toolkit. Instead of asking for everything upfront, **we create the essentials now and let the journey build additional context progressively**.

**What it does:**
- Creates `.claude/product-context/` directory
- Guides you through 2 required files (product basics, tech stack)
- Offers optional files if applicable (goals, metrics, team)
- Explains how agents will create additional context as you progress

**What you get:**
- Context reused across 1 orchestrator + 7 specialists
- Agents work with YOUR product specifics
- No repeated questions across tools
- Progressive context building through your journey

---

## Instructions

### Introduction

Display introduction message:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   Product Management Context Setup                        ║
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Quick setup to get your PM agents working with your product context.

**How it works:**
We'll create the essential INPUT files now (5-10 minutes). As you progress
through your product journey, agents will create additional context files:

- Stage 1 (Validation) → competitive-landscape.md
- Stage 2 (Understanding) → customer-segments.md
- Stage 5 (Planning) → current-roadmap.md

Your context grows as your product develops!

**What we'll create now:**

Required:
1. product-info.md - Product basics (name, description, stage, market, value prop)
2. tech-stack.md - Tech stack, architecture, constraints

Optional (if applicable):
3. strategic-goals.md - Vision, goals, priorities (we can help with product-strategist)
4. business-metrics.md - Current metrics (only if post-launch)
5. team-info.md - Team size, velocity (only if team > 1)

Ready to begin? (yes/no)
```

If user says "no", exit. If "yes", continue.

---

### Step 0: Check Existing Context

Check if `.claude/product-context/` directory exists:

```bash
ls .claude/product-context/ 2>/dev/null
```

**If directory exists** with files:
```
I found existing context files:
✓ product-info.md
✓ tech-stack.md
✓ competitive-landscape.md (created by market-analyst in Stage 1)
❌ strategic-goals.md (missing)
...

Would you like to:
1. Update existing files
2. Start fresh (overwrite all)
3. Cancel

Your choice (1/2/3):
```

**If directory doesn't exist:**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/product-context
```

```
Creating .claude/product-context/ directory...
✓ Directory created
```

---

### Step 0.5: Detect Codebase (NEW)

Before asking manual questions, check if we can auto-discover context from an existing codebase.

**Check for codebase indicators:**
```bash
# Check for common source directories and manifests
ls src/ pages/ routes/ api/ app/ package.json requirements.txt go.mod Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
```

**Codebase detected if any of these exist:**
- Source directories: `src/`, `pages/`, `routes/`, `api/`, `app/`, `lib/`
- Package manifests: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`, `Cargo.toml`

**If codebase detected:**
- Proceed to Step 0.6 (Optional Codebase Scanning)

**If NOT detected:**
- Skip scanning
- Proceed to Step 1 (Product Information - manual entry)
- Display: "No existing codebase detected. Let's set up your context manually."

---

### Step 0.6: Optional Codebase Scanning (NEW)

**If codebase was detected in Step 0.5:**

Display scanning offer:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Codebase Detected!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I've detected an existing codebase in this project.

I can scan your codebase to automatically discover:
- Features (from routes, pages, API endpoints)
- Tech stack (from package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Integrations (from 3rd party packages)
- Project scale (files, lines of code, complexity)

This takes about 30-60 seconds and saves you 10-15 minutes of manual entry.

**What gets scanned:**
- File structure and routes
- Package manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Tech dependencies
- Project size indicators

**What does NOT get scanned:**
- Code quality or architecture
- Performance or security issues
- Your code implementation details

All findings will be presented for your validation before saving.

Scan codebase now? (yes/no)
```

#### If User Says YES (Accept Scanning)

**Step 1: Invoke context-scanner**

Use Task tool to invoke context-scanner agent:

```
subagent_type: "product-management:context-scanner"
description: "Scan codebase for strategic context"
prompt: "Scan the current codebase and return structured discovery of features, tech stack, integrations, and scale. Include evidence and confidence scores for all findings."
```

**Step 2: Receive and Parse JSON**

context-scanner returns JSON with:
- features (array of discoveries with evidence)
- tech_stack (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure)
- integrations (3rd party services)
- scale (files, LOC, complexity, maturity)
- confidence_notes (explanations)
- scan_limitations (what couldn't be scanned)

**Step 3: Present Findings to User**

Display findings in readable format:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Scan Complete! Here's what I discovered:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Features Found

[For each feature in features array:]
✓ [Feature name] ([details])
  Evidence: [evidence]
  Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]

[Example:]

## Scan Limitations

[Display limitations]
Example: "Large codebase detected (5000+ files). Scanned primary directories only. May have missed features in non-standard locations."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Step 4: User Validation**

```
Is this information accurate? You can:
1. Confirm all (looks good)
2. Make corrections (add, remove, or fix items)
3. Start over with manual entry (ignore scan results)

Your choice (1/2/3):
```

**If choice = 1 (Confirm all):**
```
Great! I'll use this discovered context.

Any features or details I missed that you'd like to add? (describe or type "none"):
[User input]

[If user adds items, append to relevant sections]
✓ Added: [user's addition]
```

**If choice = 2 (Make corrections):**
```
Let's review each section:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Features Review
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[For each feature with Medium/Low confidence:]
[Feature name]: [Confidence level]

Keep this feature? (yes/no/rename)
[User input for each]

[If rename:]
What should I call it instead?
[User input]

[After reviewing uncertain features:]
Any features I completely missed? (list them or type "none"):
[User input]

✓ Features validated

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Tech Stack Review
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Display tech stack]

Is this tech stack accurate? (yes/no)
[If no:]

[For each integration:]
[Service]: [Type] - Confirm this is actively used? (yes/no/remove)
[User input for each]

Any integrations I missed?
[User input]

✓ Integrations validated
```

**If choice = 3 (Start over with manual entry):**
```
No problem! Let's set up your context manually instead.

Proceeding to manual entry...
```
Skip to Step 1: Product Information (manual flow)

**Step 5: Save Validated Data to Context Files**

Create/update context files with validated data:

**Create current-features.md:**

[Existing sections...]

## Features

[For each validated feature:]
- [Feature name]

See `current-features.md` for detailed feature inventory.

---
*Features auto-discovered: [date]*
```

**Step 6: Display Success Message**

```
✓ Context auto-discovered and validated!
✓ Saved to .claude/product-context/

Files created/updated:
- current-features.md (feature inventory)

- Agents that create strategic artifacts save back to context
- Context accumulates through your product journey

**Update Frequency:**
- Required files (product-info, tech-stack): Update when fundamentals change
- Strategic goals: Update quarterly or when priorities shift
- Metrics: Update monthly if actively tracking growth
- Journey-created files: Updated by agents as insights evolve

**Progressive Context Building:**
- Setup creates INPUT files (what agents need to start)
- Journey creates OUTPUT files (what agents generate)
- Your context grows richer as you progress through stages
