## When to Use

- After completing parallel competitor deep-dives in a competitive war room
- When synthesizing multiple researcher findings into a positioning strategy
- As a living document to save to `.claude/product-context/competitive-landscape.md`

## Best Practices

- Be honest about where competitors are stronger. Dishonest battle cards lead to lost deals.
- Cite sources for every factual claim. Competitor pricing, features, and metrics must have URLs.
- The "Killer question" in battle cards is the most valuable single line. Make it sharp.
- White space analysis is where the real strategic value lives. Don't rush it.
- Mark the date prominently. Stale competitive intel is dangerous.

**Key Principle**: Competitive analysis isn't about knowing everything about competitors. It's about knowing the three things that matter for your positioning and having evidence-backed responses ready.
