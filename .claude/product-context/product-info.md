## Description

Answer PM's hardest questions in minutes, not days. AI PM Copilot brings conversational PM expertise to solo developers and small teams through 8 specialized agents, 16 expert frameworks, and persistent product context - all inside Claude Code.

Not a project management tool. Not a generic AI assistant. A specialized copilot for product management decisions that combines:
- **Speed of AI** (answers in minutes)
- **Depth of PM frameworks** (Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, April Dunford)
- **Developer-native UX** (CLI, not web dashboard)
- **Context-aware reasoning** (remembers your product, personalizes outputs)

## Target Market

- Technical background (can code), limited PM knowledge
- Time-constrained (nights/weekends or bootstrapping)
- Want to "do PM right" but overwhelmed by enterprise methodologies
- Active in Indie Hackers, r/SideProject, Dev.to communities

**Secondary:** Small teams (2-10 people) without dedicated PM, developers transitioning to product roles

**Not for:** Enterprise organizations with PM teams, complex stakeholder management, large-scale portfolio management
