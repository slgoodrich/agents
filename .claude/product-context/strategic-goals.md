# Strategic Goals

**Period:** Q4 2025
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30

## Product Vision

Every solo developer and small team has access to world-class PM expertise and frameworks through AI, eliminating the need to hire a PM or learn PM disciplines from scratch.

## Product Positioning

### Category
**AI PM Copilot for Claude Code**

A new category following the GitHub Copilot model - AI-powered assistance that augments expertise rather than replaces it. Not a project management tool, not a generic AI assistant, but a specialized copilot for product management decisions.

### Value Proposition
**"Answer PM's hardest questions in minutes, not days"**

Subhead: *Right feature. Right users. Right time. Right reasons. Powered by AI + expert PM frameworks.*

This positioning emphasizes both strategic rigor AND speed - not fast and shallow, but rigorous answers delivered quickly. The value is answering the core questions PMs face:
- Am I building the right thing?
- For the right reasons?
- At the right time?
- For the right users?

### Key Messaging Hierarchy

**Headline:** Answer PM's hardest questions in minutes, not days

**Supporting Messages:**
1. **Framework-driven expertise**: Built on PM thought leaders (Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, April Dunford, Sean Ellis), not generic AI advice
2. **Context-aware intelligence**: Reads your product info once, personalizes all outputs (80% fewer repetitive questions)
3. **Developer-native experience**: CLI-first, works where you work (not another web dashboard to switch to)
4. **Comprehensive coverage**: 8 specialized agents covering full PM lifecycle (research → strategy → execution → launch)

**Call to Action:** Make better product decisions

### Competitive Positioning

**Position: High Rigor + High Speed Quadrant**

We occupy the unique intersection of:
- **Speed of AI** (answers in minutes)
- **Depth of PM frameworks** (Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, April Dunford)
- **Developer-native UX** (CLI, not web dashboard)
- **Context-aware reasoning** (persistent memory, not starting from zero)

**vs Enterprise PM Tools (Jira, Aha!, ProductBoard):**
- Them: Slow, complex, team-focused, expensive
- Us: Fast, AI-powered, solo-optimized, accessible
- Message: "Enterprise PM brains without enterprise PM pain"

**vs Generic AI (ChatGPT, Claude):**
- Them: Fast, general, no PM frameworks, no context persistence
- Us: Fast, PM-specialized, framework-driven, context-aware
- Message: "Not just AI - AI trained on PM best practices"

**vs Manual PM Work (Notion, spreadsheets, templates):**
- Them: Flexible, cheap, but slow and requires PM knowledge
- Us: Fast, automated, AI-guided but still rigorous
- Message: "AI does the heavy lifting, you make the decisions"

### Key Differentiators

1. **Framework-driven**: Built on PM thought leaders, not generic AI training
2. **Context-aware**: One-time setup, persistent product memory, personalized outputs
3. **Developer-native**: Lives in Claude Code where developers already work
4. **Comprehensive**: 8 specialized agents (not single-purpose tools)
5. **Strategic rigor**: Answers hard questions with depth, not just surface-level speed

### Target Market

**Primary:** Solo technical founders building their first product
- Technical background (can code), limited PM knowledge
- Time-constrained (nights/weekends or bootstrapping)
- Want to "do PM right" but overwhelmed by enterprise methodologies
- Active in Indie Hackers, r/SideProject, Dev.to

**Secondary:** Small teams (2-10 people) without dedicated PM, developers transitioning to product roles

**Not for:** Enterprise organizations with PM teams, complex stakeholder management scenarios, large-scale portfolio management

## Strategic Priorities

1. **Establish distribution foundation before launch**
   - Build awareness in developer communities (Dev.to, Indie Hackers, Reddit r/SideProject)
   - Create educational content demonstrating PM value for solo devs (blog posts, tutorials, case studies)
   - Seed waitlist and early adopter pipeline (target: 500+ subscribers pre-launch)
   - Partner with developer tool communities and complementary products

2. **Execute high-impact marketplace launch**
   - Optimize marketplace listing (title, description, screenshots, demo video)
   - Coordinate launch announcement across developer channels
   - Activate early users for testimonials and social proof
   - Prepare onboarding flow to convert installs to active usage

3. **Build feedback loops for post-launch iteration**
   - Establish metrics baseline (installs, activation rate, retention)
   - Create lightweight feedback collection (in-product, community channels)
   - Document common use cases and friction points from early users
   - Prioritize quick wins for post-launch improvements

## Key Success Metrics

1. **Pre-Launch Awareness: 500 waitlist subscribers**
   - Baseline: 0 (starting from scratch)
   - Measurement: Email capture form, landing page analytics
   - Success indicator: Building demand before marketplace availability

2. **Launch Week Performance: 100 plugin installs in first 7 days**
   - Baseline: N/A (new launch)
   - Measurement: Claude Code marketplace install count
   - Success indicator: Strong initial traction validates distribution efforts

3. **Early Activation: 30% of installers use plugin within 48 hours**
   - Baseline: Unknown (will establish post-launch)
   - Measurement: Agent invocation logs, command usage
   - Success indicator: Users find immediate value, not just installing out of curiosity

## Strategic Rationale

**Why distribution over PMF validation?**
You've validated market need through user research and early testing. The challenge is not "will people use this?" but "how do we get it in front of the right people?" Distribution is the constraint, not product-market fit.

**Why Q4 2025 focus on launch?**
Marketplace plugins are discovery-driven. Launch week momentum determines long-term visibility. A coordinated launch with pre-built awareness creates sustainable distribution through marketplace rankings and word-of-mouth.

**Why these metrics?**
- Waitlist subscribers = leading indicator of launch demand
- Install count = marketplace visibility and appeal
- Activation rate = product delivers on promise, not just marketing hype

## Strategic Trade-Offs

**Decision: Focus on breadth of awareness over depth of engagement (Q4)**
- Chosen Path: Build wide awareness across multiple developer communities
- Alternative: Deep engagement in 1-2 communities with power users
- Rationale: Marketplace launches benefit from diverse traffic sources; depth can come post-launch
- Risk: Shallow engagement may not convert to installs
- Mitigation: Educational content focused on specific pain points (feature prioritization, roadmapping) to demonstrate value

**Decision: Launch with 8 agents + 16 skills (current scope) vs. expanding pre-launch**
- Chosen Path: Launch with current feature set, iterate based on usage
- Alternative: Add 4-5 more agents (pricing strategy, analytics, user onboarding) before launch
- Rationale: Current scope is comprehensive enough to deliver value; faster launch beats perfect scope
- Risk: Missing key use cases that users expect
- Mitigation: Feedback loops in place to identify and prioritize post-launch additions

**Decision: Free plugin (no monetization) for initial launch**
- Chosen Path: Focus purely on adoption and usage, defer monetization
- Alternative: Launch with freemium model (limited free tier, paid premium features)
- Rationale: Distribution and feedback are more valuable than early revenue; build user base first
- Risk: Harder to monetize later after setting expectations
- Mitigation: Position as "early access" with future premium features (API access, team collaboration)
